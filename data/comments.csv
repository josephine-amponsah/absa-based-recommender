The rooms are comfortable and well thought out. The location is a piece of Paradise on Earth. We have a lot of wonderful memories of our time spent at Fantas. Highly recommended."

42,"Very poor service I received from fantas folly. Food took more than 2 hours and waiters were not smart too. They could not even recommend to me which of their listed food on menu is the best, one of the waitress mentioned she cannot recommend because it is not allowed. Their appearance was off for me also. Imagine going on a long journey and been given a poor service it was just heart breaking."

44,"This is the worse place, I have ever been too!! They are very rude, the service is very bad. The owner and his wife wanted to fight with costumers, never go there if you want to have a good time."
45,"Ein idyllisches Plätzchen, europäische Küche, leider nur sehr schwer zu erreichen. Möglichst ein Off-road Auto benutzen!"
46,"Nice place, very quiet, peaceful and amazing views.
The only minus was that the water from the shower and tap was not clean at all and it couldn't be used (big minus)"
47,"This is the best get away from the hectic traffic busyness and dirty beaches in Accra.   Though it is said that the road that leads to heaven is narrow, get ready for the narrow drive haha but it worths it at the end. Clean environment, good for groups , good for couples to spend quality time together. Good for family vacation, good for kids , good for long walks by the beach. I strongly recommend"

53,"The worst ever customer service I have ever experienced.  I checked in, ordered two meals and my wife surprised me with a bottle of wine. I them requested for a glass, which was brought.the manager/owner came to request for 29ghs for bringing my wine in as a guest who is accommodated there. I objected and he poured my wine in the glass away and took his glass. And he told me to check out and leave if I want to and I did just that."
54,"Best beach resort in takoradi, clean beaches, helpful personal."

Thank you Fanta, Philippe, Janet, Chef, Deborah, Ebo and the whole team.

66,An amazing place for weekend getaway.
67,"An fantastic place with an serene atmosphere located right on the Butre beach. It’s the perfect place to calm down and just enjoy yourself. The resort is built with a great sense of design and atmosphere by a nice couple taking very good care of you. I really loved this place.
The only bad thing was the internet connection that was weak, but if your not depending on internet - this is a perfect place to be."
68,"Nestled among tropical vegetation, with the sound of the Atlantic Ocean rolling into shore, you feel far away from the hustle and bustle yet it is less than an hour’s drive from the city of Takoradi.
Caution: Road is too rough. Consider Pick-up vans.

Beautiful sea beach with photogenic views. Clean area with water. The beauty of this place is the small rocky mountain ⛰.. just walk 3-4 minutes and click pictures and videos there. Adding some of the pictures.water is green, grey and yellow lol..mix colour.

Make sure you order your food in advance as they will take 2 hours if they are saying 5 minutes. I had omelette and bread and waited for 1 one hour."
69,"An excellent hideaway vacation spot for the couple who wants to get away from the busy city atmosphere. A very serene area with a beautiful beach. The food is great but takes a long time to prepare. I recommend ordering early enough so as not to be disappointed. One needs to note, however, that the resort is very far away from the main road. The road is generally smooth though. We could not find the sign at the main junction and this we missed the turn and got lost. Be sure to ask for directions. You will spend about 20-30 mins drive from the main road on dirt road before you get the resort. After the main junction there are signs at each junction so you will find your way.
I recommend this resort for couples who want a quiet, low key and affordable vacation. Just make sure you have a 4x4 😂"

122,"Green Zion Garden and the host, Ellis, left an imprint on my heart that I can never forget. Thank you."
123,"Green Zion Garden is an actual paradise. The various little/large rooms are like natural hobbit houses. No Aircon but sure a fan is grand. There's a tree house, too. The garden is immaculate, green indeed. Beautiful flowers, plants and trees. There are birds, dragonflies, a friendly goat, a couple of friendly dogs. It's right by the beach where Ellis has a beautifully decorated wooden bar. He'll feed you delicious veggie food and serve you tasty drinks. He's got the best smile. 💗There are seats & shaded beds by the ocean. The beach is so clean- no rubbish. The cleanest I've seen in Ghana. I should have stayed for longer. I'll go back one day... The village of Butre itself is across a rickety Indiana Jones style bridge and is a bustling lively fishy place. The children all ran at me for fistbumps & hi fives. Goats & chickens & dogs everywhere.
We got a motorbike to Asa Baako Festival in Busua but walked back, the full moon illuminating our way across the beach, then our headtorches helping for the path through the bush over the hilly headland, with birds frogs & insects providing the soundtrack.
A very magical special place, which seems to be growing even better with each new build & idea. Loved it 😊"
124,"I crossed rendomly the Green garden eco lodge when I was trekking on the coast.
I met Ellis there, what a positive and funny man. We ate together and had good fun. He show me the lodge, very clean and nice place. The garden is crazy.. very good moments and vibes here !"
125,Very very green space and cool environment. Great gardening and eco lodge experience
126,"They have OM sign on the outside board. You will see cats around. 10 minutes drive from fantas folly. He knows how to cook indian food. The man will offer you everything you want. Posting his picture too in the review. Offering free private parking onsite, Green Zion Garden offers pet-friendly accommodations in Butre. The bed and breakfast has lawns and hammocks for guests located in the garden. Guests can enjoy a meal at the outside garden restaurant that serves local, Indian and International cuisine. The property has an onsite bar at the garden also a coffee shop.
You will find a shared lounge at the property and Thai yoga massage treatments are available."

136,"Super lovely place. Set in the serene and beautiful ambiance of one of Ghana's beautiful coastlines,the Green Zion Garden was the perfect location for good relaxation, good and peaceful unwinding. My host, Ellis was super amazing.  A super friendly, hardworking and open minded gentle rasta man. His vegetarian cooking was top notch. His knowledge and sharing of experience was great. He prepared a bonfire for me and he is a  kind of a good drummer too [but pretty please, don't let him sing :) ] The various lodges, from the dormitories to the upper deck of the tree house, were neat, lovely and awash with beautiful colors and traditional fabric.
Bonus: when you request for a coconut, you get a fresh one which is cut from the tree right in your face.
I sure will be there again."
137,Wir kamen 06/2018 zum Abendessen vorbei - die Atmosphere im Restaurant/Lounge ist unbeschreiblich! Nach dem fantastischen Essen schnappten wir uns Djembe und Guitarre und sangen gemeinsam mit dem Gastgeber unter Mondlicht im Garten bis spät in die Nacht. Toller Ort! Ein unvergesslicher Abend.

Their staff were generally nice, but their services were poor. The breakfast buffet was very limited. We had the same options of food for our 3 night stay for breakfast.

I wouldn't add it to my favourite places in Takoradi.

235,It's an amazingly serene and luxurious place to spend a few nights and forget about the world.
236,Very nice lodge
237,Nice place
238,I stayed in the hotel for a work related retreat and liked the experience. The rooms were very clean and their facilities were standard. Their front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming but two of the staff did not depict this trait. Their conference rooms were ok even though I think the arrangements of the furniture was not fit for purpose given the nature of our engagement. I didn't get to use other facilities such as gyms and so I can't attest to its availability or state . Overall it's a lovely place especially for a weekend getaway..

The view from our window was beautiful. Showing the pool and vast green fields around the hotel.

Washroom, housekeeping and breakfast were on point. Rooms Rates are a little on the high side.

We booked a seaview chalet but could not see the sea due to the back gate and trees.
The building needs to be renovated.
The shower was not draining properly, the swimming pool lounge chairs were not in good condition and the pool beds were dirty.
We didn’t have have hot water for the first day and night, this was rectified but our first showers were cold.
We had a power cut which lasted more than an hour. The hotel should have an operational generator.
The only positive thing was the breakfast buffet with continental and freshly cooked food including local food that was very tasty."

526,"Au milieu d'un cadre de verdure impressionnant, l'Ahanta Eco Lodge recèle un magnifique jardin qui sera le décor de votre séjour.
Chambres très diverses, allant d'une suite avec salle de bain, certaines apparemment sans, jusqu'à la Beach House, accolée à l'école de surf du lodge (à noter que ces dernières sont relativement éloignées du reste du lodge, il faudra compter au moins 5 minutes de marche, en traversant le lagon à marée basse ou en passant par le village). De manière générale, la route menant à Busua et donc à l'éco lodge est plutôt chaotique et endommagée. Comptez sur un bon chauffeur et n'ayez pas peur du pont passant au dessus du lagon.
L'équipe est réactive et arrangeante (nous avons pu changer de chambre au dernier moment à notre requête, merci Fredrick!).
La cuisine est proprement FABULEUSE, avec des plats variés et un menu chaque jour différent, avec des produits locaux. Le chef saura vous surprendre avec sa cuisine authentique et faite maison.
Au bar, Francis pourra vous préparer toute une gamme de cocktails plus savoureux les uns que les autres. Mention spéciale pour son akpeteshie maison et sa bonne humeur :)
Notre séjour a été plus qu'agréable, nous espérons pouvoir revenir bientôt!"
527,"I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot. The location is beautiful, I loved the tree shower. I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side. The staff was friendly, even though more information would have been helpful at the check-in. We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning. The food was amazing (even though it was a bit pricier than at other places) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful.

The only thing that really disturbed me/us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom. We tried to pack drinks/snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff. I was personally very scared during night, because you could hear them and we saw them, too when we entered our room after a day at the beach. I called reception during the night, but they couldnt do anything about it at that point. The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof, but it didnt help. They asked for our understanding, because it was an ecolodge and animal-friendly place, but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument. Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room (which is not animal-friendly) ;) Moreover, the next night when I used the washroom, a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning. I only then read that other people had rat problems, too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible.

Still, its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua, but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience."
528,"Für mich das beste Hotel in busua. Super nettes Personal, flexibel was wünsche der Gäste angeht, grandiose Cocktails und hervorragendes essen.
Die Brücke zur lodge ist leider eine Zumutung und leider muss ich die Geschichten mit den Ratten aus anderen Rezensionen bestätigen.
Deshalb nur 4 Sterne."
529,"Schöne Unterkunft am Ende des Strandes. Es gibt Zimmer mit unterschiedlichem Komfort.
Wir waren im ""Wood House"" und das ist eher komfortabel ausgestattet.
Die Fotos sind allerdings vom ersten  Bungalow im Garten vorm Restaurant.
Das Essen ist hervorragend und die Cocktails sind auch empfehlenswert.
Wegen dem stehenden Wasser vor dem Garten ist Moskitospray dringend empfohlen. Damit kann man dann gut draußen sitzen."

533,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Ahanta. The rooms and communal area are very nicely done, very cosy and clean. 3 options are offered for dinner daily (40-70ish GHS) which were always very tasty, and as there's one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests. There are also cocktails available, and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare.

Busua doesn't offer a lot to do other than surfing (offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta), so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading. We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren't many other options. There is also the Ahanta surf/beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out. To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon, which isn't all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels. You can also walk the long way around, across a patchy bridge and through the (small and not touristy) village.

One or two other things that were less than ideal:
- daily wake up calls round 6.15 from our local rooster (in general we enjoyed observing the chickens/roosters, goats and dogs at the lodge though). Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night.
- due to the rainy season, everything was very slightly damp (bed sheets, towels, clothes) and drying was difficult, some things started to smell a little moldy
- the outside area could be improved with more places to sit, especially in the sun

Other than that we had a lovely, albeit quiet time, the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return!"

535,"Great little eco lodge cornered off by a lagoon. Stayed in budget room which as the name suggests is pretty budget but still good value for money. Showering at the gigantic tree is definitely an experience.

539,"What a great experience and this is why. My friend and I arrived some days before checking into the space. The beautiful environment was just absolutely stunning. The tall old trees , the little garden and the use of every living thing there was breath taking . You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea. That was magical.

My first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself. It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop. The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly. You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first. And if you are allergic or don’t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there.
The inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off.

We checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior.  Warm showers , free Wi-Fi and a quite and siren environment.
The workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering. They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn’t eat there the whole stay because it was delicious . My stay there was in great harmony and peaceful and I will definitely visit this place again if I have the chance. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Ahanta Eco Lodge for this experience."
540,"An Eco hotel with luxurious rooms and facilities; and an excellent restaurant with good vegetarian options.
The road to get there was challenging, but worth the effort.  The prices are a bit high, but worth it.
Special place, even if you don't want to do surfing. Tends to be fully booked, so book ahead.

- So yes rodents were seen once in the wall, as mentioned in other reviews. Not sure if it's against the spirit of eco habitat to exterminate them.  however the nature of the clay / mud eco build means new ones can borrow back  in from the surrounding forest."

544,"Could be great or terrible depending on your luck!
Let’s start with the positives: the location is great, just by the beach, the surf school and staff is amazing, surfing conditions are great for beginners and intermediates. The food is tasty and the normal rooms are beautiful, clean and well-maintained. The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter-patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once, it can just be unpleasant if you‘re scared of such animals and hearing them close by.
In the middle of our stay, a large group of 10-12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music, laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests. Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero, it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again.
Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm, it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management. While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties, I also think it’s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future. For what it’s worth, after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge, but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions, staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations.
We decided to leave the lodge early, but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4,5/5!"
545,"Very nice, clean and unique resort, great food & helpful staff. We had three wonderful days & then it really turned bad.

A huge group showed up with loud music & party all night, loud music at the breakfast and no respect for the other guests. No reaction from the staff to interrupt it. No communication from the Hotel Management. Really disappointing!

For future stays the Management should give a heads up to the other guests that a party crowd is coming."
546,"!! Watch out if you want to bring your dog or you’re fearing dogs!! The owners dog has bitten my dog several times and even attacked me when I defended my dog. He also bites humans if touching him. Even though we agreed several times that this violent dog is staying inside the office while we’re around, he was still running around. They didn’t stick to what they’ve promised us, which was unfortunate because we wanted to leave after the first attack immediately. But due to their promises we stayed. If we would have known that they have a dog who’s defending his territory by constantly attacking other dogs we wouldn’t have chosen this accommodation at the first place BESIDES we were told that this is a dogs-friendly place. I was especially shocked of the reaction of the owner Julia, who was reacting very arrogant after my dog and I got attacked, when we had to pass through the hall. To my defend I didn’t see the dog being there but when I saw him he was already on his way to attack us.
Except from the owner Julia, the team is very friendly, welcoming and makes you feel like home but I wouldn’t recommend staying there"

551,"My partner and I stayed for a week with Ahanta waves and really enjoyed our stay.
The employees are extremely welcoming and friendly.
Nevertheless I want to address some things that I wish I knew before my vacation there.

1. The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor. For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall. Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available. So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days.
2. The sea really smells. There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach. But if you walk further (ca.10 min) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell.
3. There were rats in our room. And this was something, when realised, we really struggled with. Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof. We have had our water and food poked holes into. But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me. The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls. If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room.

Ahanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind. It’s made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious (4-7 euros p.meal). We liked our stay but If the communication and rat situation were tackled our stay would definitely have been more enjoyable.
Wishing all the best."

Für mich das Highlight waren die Geräusche aus dem Wald darum. Grillen, Vögel etc.. Im Zimmer ist ein sehr gutes Frühstück enthalten. Die Anfahrt ist ein Abenteuer. Es geht über eine Brücke die mit Stahlplatten belegt ist. Leider ist die Bucht vor dem Resort versandet und ein Abfluss zum Meer fliest daran vorbei. Das Meer und die Wellen sind super. ACHTUNG STRÖMUNG bei Ebbe. Man kann dort Wellensurfen. Der Ort gegenüber ist ein kleiner typisch ghanischer Ort. Wir haben dort in der Nähe der Schule in einer Hütte FuFu gegessen. Ein Highlight für Alle."

I was in Ghana for a few weeks from the states and wanted to check out the local surf scene, so that is how I found myself at Ahanta Eco Lodge.

The room was clean, air conditioned and settled between large trees down a stone pathway.

The food at the restaurant/lounge area was delicious! Chef did a great job.

Bebe the surf instructor is a super cool guy that was eager to share his home waves and some technique to help me have an extra food time in the water.

It takes some effort to get to this place, but once there, its a really great spot! I would 100% stay here again."

924,This was a pleasant place to stay. The staff were pleasant. We wanted to go away for a few days then come back but despite repeated asking they would not confirm if there was a room - which was unhelpful. The food is vegan only which was not clear from the website.
925,"Die Zimmer sind grundsätzlich sauber und das Gebäude ist in einem schönen weiß gestrichen. Auf dem eher kleinen Außengelände gibt es Sitzgelegenheiten und zwei Hängematten sowie eine Bar bzw. Rezeption. Auch kann man auf der Dachterasse gemütlich sitzen,

Einzig gefällt mir die Beleuchtung in unserem Zimmer nicht: Sehr schwaches und kaltes Licht."
926,"Wunderschöner romantischer Ort mit wahnsinnig lieben Menschen. Veganes Essen, saubere Zimmer. Wir waren leider nur eine Nacht dort, aber hier her komme ich ganz bestimmt wieder. Zum Strand kommt man zu Fuß in 5 Minuten und der ist sehr sauber."
927,"Es ist hier ruhig und entspannt, gemütliche Hängematten und eine Dachterrasse laden zum Verweilen ein. Nancy, die Gastgeberin, ist eine Perle. Sie hat uns sogar im Zimmer zurückgelassenes Trinkgeld hinterher gebracht, weil sie glaubte, wir hätten es vergessen. Das Frühstück ist gut, Nancy kauft sogar in Takoradi Mandelmilch. Die Zimmer sind ruhig und besser als wir bei dem Preis erwartet hätten. Am Strand ist man in 5 Minuten zu Fuß. Die Umgebung ist abends etwas dunkel, aber unseres Wissens nach sehr sicher."

931,Very nice Ressort with a friendly host that cooks very nice food (vegan). The rooms are clean and the rooftop is just beautiful to hang out there even when it rains.
932,We stayed one week at this place. The staff is amazing! Nancy is a phenomenal chef and served us delicious meals all day long. I'm not vegetarian but did not miss anything. We could easily pre-order food over WhatsApp which was very nice. Abu is the guy who works the hole day and he can repair literally everyting. We wanted to make a long bicycle tour and Abu spent a full day just for us to make sure the bicycles are in perfect condition. It was a pure joy to stay there and I would recommend this 100%.
933,"I stayed here with 3 friends and we loved it. Nancy and staff were very welcoming - they always put cushions out for us and even got us freshly picked coconuts. The food was very good and Nancy catered for a large group of us. Our room was bright, comfortable and clean with clean linen and towels provided.  We loved the garden, the hammocks and the outdoor shower. It was a great place to relax. There is also a roof terrace where you can play games or relax. We extended our stay by one night and would have stayed longer if we could. We 100% recommend!"

935,"Dit is de verborgen parel van Busua, zoveel charme..
- lekker vegan eten van Nancy,
- uncle Abu die altijd alles doet om het je naar je zin te maken,
- een rustige plek waar de koele bries elke dag een beetje beter maakt,
- een plek waar wij met onze dochter van 1 ook heel goed terecht konden, omdat de appartementen uitkijken op de tuin. Zo konden wij een drankje doen of eten terwijl zij op bed lag.

Al met al, ga je naar Busua, twijfel niet en ga hier heen. Voor mij de meest rustgevend plek."

Really enjoyed my stay"
958,"Clean, spacious room, friendly employees, really nice property. Wouldn’t recommend the food, we paid 25 GHS each for very strange and unsatisfying veggie burgers that took over an hour to arrive. It was ludicrous, it felt like a practical joke. The burger was a tiny soggy mess on top of one slice of bread, and there were two pitiful slices of potato beside it. Very disappointing to two very hungry people. Other than the food all was well. If you stay here I would recommend seeking meals elsewhere."
959,Relaxing hotel with friendly staff
960,"I enjoyed my stay here, rooms are quite iluminated and clean. Nancy was super helpful and made breakfast super fast every time - her banana pancakes are tasty! They dont offer coffee option during bfast, so you need to go elsewhere if youre a morninh coffee drinker.
As the guest of LG, you get to have a special offer for surfing classes, which is great. Also, they have a sister B&B by the beach called Coconut Dream that is a nice spot to hang out when you need a break from the sun.
It was further away from the beach than I expected and you have to go through a small neighbourhood of houses with limited access to water, which felt invasive some times."

I've travelled the whole of Ghana and it is by far the nicest beach in Ghana with a perfect swimming beach. Food is wonderful and the rooms and simple but have clean and comfortable.

It’s an amazn place with a pool.. ocean view.
And great outdoors bar/ patio.
It became a home away from home,  6weeks x 2….
The staff and owners are just amazing as the cooks… the food is Superb…. The Charcoal Grilled Lobster is Super!!!!!.. even better yet!!! On my  first day, pulling in… there was a truck unloading a 200lb. grouper… absolutely lip smacking

The room I had, over looked the pool… Very comfy beds … AC worked great!
great times….

Bottom line! Ever time I was in need… I was helped, from getting cash advance on my visa to laundry being done

It is some what mountainous, with trails.
I would travels  these, my coolest find was a boars tusk…

1112,"I am simply posting here again because you can't respond to a post once the owner has posted. I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast. My father passed away some time back, I came with my friend, and we certainly did not receive a discount. The toilet seat was dirty, there's no way around that, I cleaned it.  I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service. We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge. The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late, no arguing that, even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times. There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food. My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready. We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest, he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day. I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came, at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told. I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously. I caution those that want to book at Safari Beach Lodge. I truly wish the renovations are your only problems and once that is resolved the place can operate normally."

1183,What a magical place! The name paradiso is a correct name because it's a true paradise. The owner Gina is really nice and a great cook! The rooms are great and you've got a amazing view when you wake up. I would definitely recommend this place! Gina heel erg bedankt voor de goede service en de gezellige movienight!
1184,"My stay at Paradiso was everything I could have hoped for and SO much more. I left Busua with a community of friends who made my stay unlike any other trip I have been on. Gina, the host, is beyond accommodating and her staff is friendly, attentive, responsive, and a joy to be around. The property also surprised me. The location is perfect, a 3-4 minute walk from the beach and the chaos of the ""downtown"" Busua area, and feels extremely private. The view is stunning, right on the water overlooking Busua beach and Abokwa Island. The rooms were spacious and clean.

I can't thank Gina enough for everything she did for us, and a huge thanks to her staff (shout out to Anita for making such AMAZING meals). I will not think twice about staying here again when I return to Busua. Until next time!"
1185,"Gina’s place is the most beautiful and peaceful in Ghana. We enjoyed the food, the clean and amazing houses, the great hospitality and very friendly staff. Tonny and Anita are taking good care for their guests. The beach in Busua is absolutely clean, surfing is perfect! Thanks a lot for all!"

1188,"Beautifully located small resort with six round chalets (1-2 persons each) with superb ocean views. An ideal place to just relax and enjoy the nice, quiet scenery at daytime with nothing but the breaking waves of the ocean and the crickets to hear at night. Nice, wide sandy beach is accessible within minutes by foot. The resort is in good condition (rooms with restroom and shower, moscito screens, fan, fridge, safe), especially considering that the place is in the heart of real Africa. The owner and her personnel are warm and very friendly and will do everything to accommodate your needs and make your stay a pleasant one. Even if you come for only a short stay, by no means miss the excellent cuisine; the owner and her assistant will prepare very tasty, freshly made breakfasts, lunch or dinner in local and/or international style. Full recommendation!

Eine wunderschöne kleine Anlage mit sechs runden Zimmern im Bungalowstil (für je 1-2 Personen) mit herrlichem Ozeanblick. Ideal, um einfach mal auszuspannen und die schöne, ruhige Landschaft bei Tag und nichts als Meeresbrandung und Grillenzirpen bei Nacht zu genießen.  Herrlicher, breiter Sandstrand zu Fuß in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Die Anlage ist in gutem Zustand (Zimmer mit Dusche und WC, Mückenschutz, Ventilator, Kühlschrank, Safe), insbesondere wenn man bedenkt, im Herzen des wahren Afrikas zu sein. Die Leitung und das Personal sind sehr freundlich, die Atmosphäre familiär und alles wird getan, den Wünschen des Gastes entgegenzukommen und den Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten. Auch wenn man nur kurz bleiben sollte, darf man die sehr gute Küche nicht auslassen. Die Managerin und ihre Assistentin bereiten alle Mahlzeiten (Frühstück, Mittag- und Abendessen) frisch und sehr schmackhaft zu, egal ob afrikanische oder europäische Gerichte. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
1189,"Wonderful gem, hidden away from the bustle, overlooking the ocean. A paradise for real, and Mama Gina makes sure it stays that way. She goes out of her way to make us feel at home. Every meal is home cooked and fresh. Sit under the canopies, gaze into the ocean and just relax :)"

One of the best beaches in Ghana, clean white sand and good natural views. The staff was nice and the food was decent, but the service was usually slow. If you're considering order lunch to be brought to you in the beach, do it 2 hours in advance. The rooms were confortable, but outdated. Forget the pool..."

From the point of students and academics purposes and low budget this is an ok place.
It’s quite a low class place but due to its location near or on campus makes it easy for one to avoid moving long distances in order to save time and avoid stress if one needs to be close by for campus and surrounding activities.
I wonder why they are invisible when I was searching for ‘hotels close by’ online,
Hope they do something about it to enable easy and quick online visibility ."

We ended up having to call the taxi cabs again and take us to many hotels and shop for  accommodations that take credit cards which is hard to find in this area and the only reason why we booked in the first place.

1602,"The room was clean and comfortable (for the price).  Furniture is dated and mostly damaged.
I travelled from USA with 2 teenage girls, Jan 2023.  We had a king size bed.  The bed was big enough for us to sleep comfortably.  Wifi is only available for 1 device per room.  Imagine having 2 teenagers that have to share wifi connection.  I’ve never heard of this.  To top it off the internet cuts out at 12am sharp.  It’s as though they turn the internet box off.  Then they advertise free breakfast.  This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd. The breakfast is the same for everyone. Absolutely no substitutions. The breakfast consisted of fried egg, baked bean, spring roll, bread and a bit of green salad.  Portion is very small.  The eggs were good.  Had to throw out everything else.  Very sad, bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn’t be eaten.  The pool is very unkept.  Water is dirty. Thankfully this stay was only for one night.  The staff made me want to pull my hair out!  They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them.  They don’t like to be asked questions.  When you do ask they act as if they don’t hear or understand my plain English. Then when they respond in a very soft/low voice and it’s always sorry.  They are not informative, rather very timid. But they communicate loud and clear amongst themselves.  Overall I wish I could go back in time and get my night back."

1909,"Service impeccable. Le personnel est très avenant, gentil et discret.

L'emplacement est très agréable avec un grand jardin, des espaces de jeux et l'accès au lac. Bel environnement, très paisible. Parfait pour l'observation des oiseaux (prévoyez des jumelles ou longue-vue)

Cuisine excellente, généreuse et variée. Tout est fait sur le moment donc il ne faut pas être pressé. Vous pouvez commander en avance.

Les chambres sont grandes et correctes. Peu de pression d'eau pour la douche.
Possibilité de garer sa voiture à côté de sa chambre.

L'accès est cependant compliqué. Les routes sont difficilement praticables. Assurez vous d'avoir le véhicule qui convient. C'est un endroit plutôt isolé, comme les autres logements proposés autour du lac. Il faut savoir que c'est un ensemble de petits villages vivant ici. Il faudra vous acquitter de 10ghs par personne pour accéder à la vallée."
1910,"PROS:
I spent a night there. In fact, their service is top notch. The rooms are neat, my AC functioned well, the environment was neat except for the lake side which had recently been used by some other people before i got there.
The food is superb. I had the opportunity to take variety of their meals; Breakfast (Milo, pancake, bread with fried eggs), Lunch (Fufu and Aponkye Light soup), Supper (Banku and Tilapia plus Special local potatoes with chicken), i ordered for special pop corn, khebab and fried plantains. Their food is by far the best ive tasted from any resort.
The owner Maa Patricia is very friendly but  i met these two people (Solomon and Seiba), woooooooooow, their customer service and assistance is overwhelming. I will not hesitate to visit the place a second time.

Cons:
Despite the nice environment,  there were few negatives. The road leading to the place was very bad and far. There were no walls around the resort (security concerns), didn't really see any security guard around. They had some security cams but it was far from the car park.

But in all I really enjoyed my stay."

1944,"My first experience here was in June 2021. I fell in love with the place. The water, the trees, the birds of different colours! Oh my! I couldn’t help but come here this weekend of my birthday Oct 2nd-4th! It was a magical experience as I swam in the lake Bosomtwe for the first time, I did my meditations by the lake at 5am with the birds singing the sun rising and the calm of the lake. The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn’t changed. It feels like home. They even made me a surprise birthday local food! I will never forget this weekend. The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything. When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave. They rained insults on the whole place. I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour. If you have food just eat at home. You can’t bring food to a restaurant! Why do we do this to good businesses? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen. Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021. Can’t wait to see blue and green birds and swim in lake Bosomtwe. I could live there all my life :)"

1951,I loved how neat and serene the place was. It’s a good place to visit when you want to run away from all the chaos in the city. And the customer service was wonderful as well.
1952,Good place to relax and unplug. Location is perfect but waiting service can be better. Will recommend this place if you're looking for cool place to get away.

1954,"We really enjoyed Blue Diamond. Easy booking, great communication, easy to find and really not a bad drive from Accra. Ordering drinks and meals was an easy WhatsApp message. We ordered food one night, which was good and we brought bbq for the second night. I like that they allow you to bring your own food. The rooms are super basic but we spent all our time at the beach anyway. The beach is clean and safe to swim in. Decent waves for boogie boarding and even some surfing (there was a decent break down the beach a bit). It feels good to find a place to escape Accra and really be required to do nothing but relax."
1955,"Nice clean beach getaway from Accra. Beautiful shoreline with some waves for body surfing (closes out too quick for surfing). Resort food is yummy. You can bring your own charcoal and grill food your own as well. Dmall nighltly bonfire (weekends only?). Small but clean pool. Very nice spot for families. Drinks were on thr pricier side, but you can order them up via WhatsApp which is convenient. Rooms had AC and a mini fridge - honestly didn't spend much time in thr room awake. No stores nearby so bring your own snacks and maybe water. Rooms get sandy - a floor mat would be nice inside the door. Manager person (owner? German lady) had great communication skills)."

It has a clean beach and view is picture perfect.
Service staff is very polite and professional in approach.
Long walks (7-10 Km) on beach is normal.
villagers fishing  nearby adds to experience of local people & culture.
Ride the waves get your board.
Swings, hammock under coconut trees give you true feel of beach resort.
Rooms are functional but well maintained.

1961,"Just came back from a 2 day stay getaway at Blue Diamond. Firstly the communication was as 100%. All questions prior to booking were answered well and on time on the WhatsApp.

The outside: Arriving at the resort was easy we informed them of our arrival and someone met us at the gate. As you drive in you can feel the peace and serenity of the resort. It’s very clean and the beach is well kept with lovely palm trees and shaded seating tables by the beach side.

The Rooms: We booked a conjoining family room. I must say the rooms were a big disappointment. The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture.

Food: Ordering food is very easy. A quick whatsapp gets you a quick response. However the food is 5/10 and overpriced for the quality. Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip. Cocktails are very nice. The blue diamond is as a hit. So was the Last Prayer

Overall the tranquility of the place makes up for rooms and the food and that’s why I’m giving a 4*"
1962,"Stephanie was the absolute hostess , she was very efficient and all ,  via WhatsApp , she provided very clear communication to address every situation. The food was great , everything on the menu WAS available , loved the grilled lobster, prawns provencal, and the sea food linguine , and the beach front was amazing , we absolutely loved eating our meals right on the beach front and falling asleep to the sound of the sea , a beach resort worth visiting , the rooms are basic but the beach is so worth it .I would do it again ."

Why don’t you allow walk in customers coming all the way from Accra just to have lunch? What’s so precious Inside, that walk in customers have to be turned away at the gate?? Ridiculous behaviour by the lady manager who spoke on phone!! Will never visit or recommend this place to any one again!!"

Flies all over the place
Insects in the bed (yes, in the bed)

Owner super unfriendly and does not care about the guests. Didnt even try to assist.

During the night there is no one to assist if something happens.

I came withy wife and slept maybe 4 hours because of the mosquitos.

Really not recommend.. photos are misleading, we really didnt expect that from a German hotel manager."
1997,"I came with my husband for a relaxing night at the blue diamond and was attacked in my room by 100 mosquitos. My husband needed medical attention during the night and no one was there to assist, not even with a first aid kit.
The owner didn't even ask about it in the morning.

Rooms are equipped with a specific glass that attracts birds and Around 5 am small birds just knocked my window so hard we werent able to sleep. We slept 4 hours roughly on a vacation night.

Many flies were around when we had breakfast.

The place looks nice but not everything that shines is gold.

Really bad experience overall mostly because of the lack of availability and caring from the owners.

Highly NOT recommended."

The resort has a large reception with television and fridge. The resort also has a very big golf course which is still under expansion. It has six chalet rooms which has a traditional outside design but with ultra modern inside design. Shama beach is the best place to be for your holidays and they have the best reception ever.

Bed was comfy and massive, and as a family of 5, they were kind enough to bring us a matress as well.

The outdoor jacuzzi was nice, and there was  pool and play equipment for the kids, which we all loved.

Staff were so friendly & welcoming, special mention to Jessica from the breakfast buffet she was so helpful and friendly, but all the staff were.

The only reason this does not have 5 stars is the condition of the roads & no transport provided from the hotel. Roads are awful. The potholes are massive.
Resort would benefit greatly, maybe having a contract with a taxi company or drivers to ferry customers to and fro from the hotel.
If you do get a driver organised, please agree prices beforehand, as we had someone charge us 100GHS to take us 10 minutes down the road, which is a lot of money.

Would definitely recommend the resort to anyone, and will definitely be back."

2169,"First, they have good food. And most other things were ok. However, I give them 1 star because the most important thing to me was Internet access. It was the worse experience I've had in a while. It's a commercial property for God's sake.

What would it take to provide proper WiFi coverage for the rooms, conference rooms, and public areas like restaurant and pool areas? Some of us are happy to pay for it. But it was hard to even receive a single WiFi bar at most of these areas. And WiFi was especially necessary as mobile phone signals are weak due to the location's distance from the main town.

For this reason and their nonchalant attitude towards providing reliable Internet access (paid or free) to guests, I give them 1 star."
2170,Great View but Very Bad Service... When you pay for Swimming the resort provides Towels. But you have to hassle staff to get your towel..nobody cares as soon as they take their money..Very Bad food service..food took over 2hrs after ordering when we were promised 30mins... We had to leave..Honest Advice: Great place but make sure you eat at home before going

The rooms had nice mattresses but just a sheet to cover you, and the shower is unpracticle and a pain to use.

The pool was nice, although it is saltwater. The beach is in walking distance just past the beautiful stone wall (the pictures aren't updated,the beach isn't right there anymore) but you can not swim in there, the current is too strong! The people were nice, and the owner even tried to speak in french to my grandma, who couldn't speak English well.

2228,"We arrived dusty, tired, and world weary from Kumasi. From other experiences in our stay I was skeptical that the location would be good. I was wrong— it was great!

We were greeted by Mr. Kweku who runs the operation. He quickly checked us in, answered some questions about getting around, visiting the national forest, and returning to Accra, and then insisted that we relax.  We were shown to our room by the excellent Mr. Henry and Ms. Vivian, both of whom kindly showed us around and ensured we were taken care of throughout our visit.

The room isn’t a room at the ritz. Let me confirm what some other reviews— it’s hot and the AC can take a bit to cool the room down. But on the positive side, the water pressure is great (and hot) and the bed is comfortable enough.

The pool is lovely, if a bit warm, and provides and amazing view of the crashing ocean waves, sunrises, and sunsets.

The restaurant provides a mix of western and African food which we really enjoyed! If you are visiting Africa and having trouble finding local dishes we’d recommend checking this place out even if you’re just visiting.

The lodge arranged drivers for us to the National Park and back to Accra at a reasonable price, and helped us get taxis into the city to visit the castles.

Overall an excellent stay!"

2236,Have you enjoyed a whole night warming yourself under the sea breeze ? How does the serene environment of an abode enhances your relaxation and productive nights away from all disturbances. You are not getting me anymore. I am talking about this cool African traditional Rainbow Resort. There are more to experience than I do if you take those imagery yourself. It's affordable and pays highest welcome to international people. In fact they have a beautiful international reception. I just love African Rainbow Resort.

2243,Stayed here in '08. Clean and nice from memory. Banged this girl and she was so loud it woke up the entire place. They didn't seem to mind + had a good breakfast in the morning as well!

2247,"While the quality of the cuisine offered at this establishment is exemplary, it is regrettably hampered by the protracted delivery time. In practical terms, one would be wise to order lunch in the morning to ensure that it arrives in a timely fashion, as ordering in the afternoon may result in dinner being served instead.
In addition to this, the establishment is found wanting in several other areas. The quality of the internet connectivity is substandard, the level of attention and care provided by the food service staff is inadequate, and despite featuring a menu, cocktails are not available for consumption. As a result, these aspects are not deserving of any rating and are left unmarked.
However, the accommodations themselves are of a superior standard and deserve a rating of two stars for their quality."

2251,"What a beautiful place. We really needed some days to recharge, this place was perfect. The staff is friendly and they try to fulfill every wish. They extra organised soya milk for us. The beach view is stunning, we enjoyed breakfast there and the beach towels are huge :). It’s possible to swim in the sea. They are building a pool. The place and the rooms are clean. the food is freshly made so is normal that it takes a while, the waiters are informing and its also mentioned in the menu. The food is delicious especially the pizza & fish. We definitely are coming back."
2252,"Beautiful place. If you are looking for rest and relaxation, this is the place for you. Beautiful well-kept beach, with a wonderful backdrop. You can swim well in the sea. Rooms clean and well-kept. Fine food, is freshly prepared and therefore takes a little longer. The waiters draw attention to this and take the order early enough. They are very guest-oriented and try to fulfill all wishes, prepared and organized meals that were not on the menu. They are working on a pool that looks like it should be ready in a few weeks."

Would definitely stay here again."

2262,Room are great and fancy. Everything works perfectly in the rooms. Family friendly with kids playground and activities. Down side is restaurant service and food. Service is super slow and food needs improvement. Breakfast buffet was emptied by 9am with half of the guests were left in limbo. Tables couldn’t be cleared to next guest with no where to sit. Had breakfast next to dirty dishes. We had a 2hr drumming and dancing session around 8-10 pm which wasn’t ideal if you’re a light sleeper and also considering it’s meant to the a tranquil escape. There’s more room for improvement.
2263,"Very nice resort, chalets are well spaced, rooms are nice and cozy, bed was very comfortable. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The scenery is beautiful. Only downside, if you don't have your own mode of transport, it can be very expensive if you want to go into town."
2264,"Quite a drive from the main Accra~Takoradi highway, the road is a little bad in bits but the view and serenity of Charlestina makes it worth it.
Very clean beach and calm, warm water.
Very friendly and attentive staff and good accommodation amenities. Price perfect location for a get away from the chaos of Accra!"

Very warm welcome on arrival. Staff polite.
Butler available at the villa which made life much easier.
We were shown round the beautiful resort and the beaches are ooooooooh.
Great scenery for picture taking. Look out for they ones waterfalls. Totally enjoyed my stay with friends. While touring the property it began to rain and out of no where staff appeared with umbrellas! Customer service is excellent generally.
However the staff embarrassed us when we were checking out. . A towel couldn’t be found so they demanded payment for it. This was settled when the towel was found at the villa and apology remdered. A very unnecessary and avoidable incident. And for the price paid to lodge, a missing hand towel shouldn’t be the reason to chase guests down.
That’s why I give 4 star. Otherwise it’s is heavenly.
Very expensive property. Go prepared 😀"

The architect isn’t so impressive apart from the reception hall.
Most of the fridges, and settings in the lounge were outmoded.
The staff were friendly and had contact to drivers who helped us around town.
I couldn’t use the gym and tennis courts but they well maintained.

2397,"Axim Beach Resort is such a magical place! ✨️ I will try to explain for you to get a better understanding of how beautiful this resort is. This resort, I believe, does not make enough ""noise"" bcos mehnnn! They should! The resort I tucked away on the beautiful hills of Axim. It is a little out of town and even though I travelled with Larry who drove and I played the role of the Princess we were both mesmerised by the sight of this amazing place right on entering the premises. All the rooms are chalets with beautiful sea views that you only need to see for yourselves to understand the extent of the beauty I am trying to explain here! There is a beautiful pool downhill that one can easily sight from the top due to its extremely blue colour. The pool was very clean and very well maintained. The lawns beautifully manicured and the natural materials incorporated into the building of the chalets  together with the view give the whole place a very authentic feel and make one intuned with nature. The beach has lots of coconut trees and so there's enough shade to relax and enjoy the Sea breeze. Part of the beach is covered with carpet grass, which was grown by the resort. We were there for just a day, but the grill at the beach suggests fun nights at this resort. We ordered some drinks on ice and food 😋.  Of course, they didn't disappoint.The meal was super tasty. We were sad when it was finally time for us to leave. We have not stopped talking about Axim Beach Resort and Spa since we got back and, of course, am planning a long stay there very, very, very soon. The best resort in Western Ghana if you ask me and their prices are also very reasonable."

They have a swimming pool, a beach, a mini football pitch, and archery, all of which I had a chance to enjoy during my visit. The entrance fee to use the facilities was GHC 200, which I thought was reasonable was quiet on the high side for kids.

In addition to the facilities, the food at Lou Moon was also very good, it doesn’t come cheap. I had a chance to try a few different dishes and they were all delicious.

The customer service at Lou Moon was excellent. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to make my day visit enjoyable. They were always available to answer any questions I had.

My only issue with Lou Moon was the refuse dump at the entrance of the hotel. It was a bit of an eyesore and detracted from the overall beauty of the property.

Overall, my experience at Lou Moon was fantastic. I would definitely visit again and recommend it to others."

2474,"This is around July 2022...

The Concept is good. I thought I was in for a good disappointment on seeing the main entrance and the bad road to the resort.

Reception was good even though I arrived a day before my booking dates!

I got the standard room for a night since my booked room was occupied.

My biggest problem was the bed. They're not spring mattresses and so you end up making craters in them after some time. Craters are not comfortable. Unfortunately, it's the same bed at our island room.

At the time, some construction was going on, which was for a pool...i was happy about the idea but not so much for the noise.

Food is good. Doesn't look enough but it is. But with one of my seafood dinners, the lobster was not fresh.

Regardless, I would go back one day...must be budgeted for though. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"

The staff and service is excellent!! They are responsive and thoughtful without being intrusive or overbearing. They reflect Ghanaian hospitality at its best. The food and drinks were very good.  The soups are excellent and we had some great dinnertime meals. If you are looking for R & R this is the place.  The service is really next level which truly elevated our experience. Wholeheartedly recommend!"
2492,"We booked a villa and standard room at Lou Moon in May. Very helpful and wonderful staff. Fred our butler was the BEST when we return I hope he is still there. He was very attentive and met all of our needs. The villa was stunning to say the least. I booked from US and they worked with me for booking which was great. Cannot wait to return.
Con: it is not fully inclusive. For the price this is a standard and the only reason why I did not give 5 stars. Drinks are not included and you pay for all meals that aren’t provided in your package. Be careful and ask questions about your package to make sure you understand fully what you are paying for."
2493,"As a hotel this is an absolutely stunning place in a dramatic and enchanting location. Very stylish rooms and villas in beautifully maintained grounds and complemented by friendly and helpful local staff. Ghanaian warmth and international luxury combined. Good watersport facilities too with a shelterd cove offering some protection from the ocean swell.
But take your own sandwiches or demand a self-catering facility. During our recent visit there was no sign of anyone with any cooking skills at work in the kitchen. We witnessed wonderful seafood being brought to the place by local fishermen but the food that appeared in front of us seemed to have come from a different planet. Old reviews of the Lodge praise the cuisine, but it has changed hands fairly recently and things must have gone badly wrong in the kitchen. The dining room is in a great location as is the bar, where the  cocktails are worthwhile thank goodness.
Unlimited potential with wonderful staff and luxurious rooms. But the food could not be worse. Nil stars for dining.

2022 - Looking through recent reviews I notice that many praise the food in the standard default way that is commonplace on the web. But there are still a few warnings about the catering appearing. So I stand by my advice. Self-cater after enjoying a drink and cocktails at the wonderful bar with perhaps a bowl of chips...."

2496,Six hour mission from Accra and we arrived at the Ank Beach resort. Stunning location. We stayed in a family bungalow near the sea. Very spacious. Very slow food service which is the Ghana way.

No matter if you are into cocktails on a sun bed below palm trees (served by the friendly staff right at the beach), splashing in the waves in flat water or beginner-level surfing (a small selection of boards can be rented directly from the hotel and apparently the hotel can arrange for a surf instructor as well but I didn‘t try), look no further than this beach resort.
Compared to other places, the entire spacious site including the beach is super well maintained and clean so you can enjoy nature to the fullest.
You can also dive into a number of activities offered by the hotel like hikes, visits to nearby forts or a stilt village river tour but we didn‘t try any of those. Having a car at your disposal comes in handy as the transit to and from, e.g., the stilt village was much more expensive than the activity itself.
I recommend to afford the extra money and book a Deluxe Room in one of the bungalows close to the beach as the less expensive options are located on the other side of the road behind the resort and require a short walk to enter the main area which we thought felt a bit detached.
I can definitely recommend this place!"
2501,"We stayed for a week and absolutely loved it there. The place is super beautiful and the beach is very clean. Food was delicious and the stuff very friendly. If you want to stay directly in the beach front make sure to book the deluxe rooms, as the cheaper ones are located a little behind the Resort. We didn’t do any activities they offer as we found them rather expensive, so I cannot say anything about them.
There is the possibility to do laundry (extra costs) and you can pay via credit card. I would recommend staying here 100%."

2503,"It is an excellent scenery in the forest reserve facing the sea. It has a natural feel and fresh ecology.  Good for relaxation and quietness.
For those who love surfing 🏄‍♂️ this is a good location for you.
The breeze is cool, and the water is not that cold."
2504,"At the end of our backpacking trip to ghana, we stayed for 4 nights at the ankobra beach resort.
We enjoyed the relaxation very much. The area is very beautifully designed. The beach is amazing, we could swim well and walk from there to Axim.
The breakfast was rather weak in comparison and price-performance ratio... the food in general was no culinary highlight but okey.
We were a bit disappointed about the excursion that they offer on the website. The small ankobra tour was not as described on the website (much shorter and less programme points for the same price). Also, the big ankobra tour does not take place every Saturday. We expected this and planned to fly home on Monday instead of Sunday to do the tour on Saturday, which was a bit a pitty. Nevertheless we enjoyed ojr stay there a lot."
2505,"Perfect location, at the estuary of the Ankobra River. Service is not that perfect but good.

The rooms are moderate."
2506,A beautiful natural environment for relaxation.

Walking at the shore and swimming in the morning after breakfast is just beautiful experience. And my stay was one of a kind and a memorable trip with my family. ❤️🥰

My highlight of my stay was when they still operated the cinema for just me to watch a movie( I low key thought they would say they can’t show a movie for just one person because of electricity cost). The only downside for me was the pool, it needs to be cleaned more frequently but I still enjoyed my morning swim. 9/10 for me. It’s a place I would love to visit again."

The only difference between breakfast lunch and dinner was the bread and juices served during breakfast. Booked a stay for 4 days and had to ditch the last day because I was sick of eating the same food three times a day. Breakfast lunch and dinner gatherings looked like a 50th year old birthday party. There is no variety in the meals. Oh and there was a brass band playing PRESBY tunes or whatever. I thought it was independence day. Breakfast juice was frutelli. Water dispenser was not the best. Pool water 😩. Bathroom is unnecessarily big. And oh don’t leave your money in your room for house keeping. I m tired of typing just change your mind."

The room we booked for had a problem and we just couldn’t stay in there and when the issue was reported it took the reception forever to get someone to come and check luckily we met the manager when we went for dinner and he asked if we were enjoying our stay and we told him we had an issue he quickly arranged for our room to be changed. And they came back in some few minutes after we moved in to ensure we were ok with the room. I was really impressed because some resorts don’t respond quickly to the needs of clients. Their food was also nice my favorite was definitely the breakfast buffet. Even though I’m not a breakfast person I love breakfast buffets anytime I go on getaways.

We only were there for two nights, and although it was short, our stay was really really good.
The pool, the little houses with its special roofs, the vegetation, palms, trees, flowers… the stone paths… it all forms a perfect site to spend a few days totally relaxed, and if there are people incredibly kind and helpful as there really are, your stay will be as good as ours.

Thank you to all this people, to every one of them who were constantly there to make our stay so lovely as it was: Stephen, Solomon, Jeff, George and Prince.

(A little note: when you are at the restaurant, they take time to bring you your order).

Anyway, I hope we can repeat the experience, we will be delighted!"

The food service can be slow, anywhere from 30 min to an hour, although everything is made on site and fresh so as long as you plan ahead, it’s not an issue. Overall highly recommend it!"
2616,"My friends and I had an Amazing time at Lemon!  It was my 1st time in Ghana, and I celebrated my birthday while staying at Lemon.I was very pleased my corner unit, top floor Continental Double accommodations. From my balcony, the view of the sea, beach and the property line, gave me a beautiful serene feeling. The pictures online definitely match the actual property. The food, drinks, beach, pool, staff, and activities (African drumming and dance; beach bonfire; visit to local school) added another layer of greatness to my stay. The owners were on location and made it a point to engage with the guests. The staff was super accommodating, kind, and professional. I have to give a special shout out to the restaurant servers that gave me an amazing birthday song and dance! Emmanuel, August, Richard, Isaac, and Dennis- you guys were amazing! Lemon knows how to do it right- service, accommodations, activities, cleanliness, and attentiveness. Another great thing about Lemon is that at my request, they coordinated for me a visit to a local primary school. It is there were I committed to sponsoring a child for school supplies/fees. If you are looking to support a child's education
, ask for Dennis.
Lemon will be a repeat for me."

We stayed at the Lemon Beach Resort for a week and had a pleasant and relaxing time. From the first welcome to checkout everything was great! Kofi and all the Lemons in the restaurant and the whole resort took care of the guests very personally, individually and professionally.

Our room was very spacious and clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom had a large shower. The room had air conditioning, a fridge and WiFi available.

The beach is 4min walk away but the poolside is perfect to take a swim and relax in the sun with a nice drink.
Their restaurant offers good variety on international and local kitchen for affordable prices. The complimentary breakfast is good.

We recommend a stroll through Elmina market and city with its historic and colorful buildings. Also the Batic workshop, where you learn how to create your own Batic design cloth in a very friendly environment. Other activities are available on request.

Medaase and will will be back!"

2701,"So, this is arguably one of the worst hotels I’ve lodged in. I was beyond disappointed. Where do I start from? I spent 3 nights here and I was truly letdown. First off, during the day I was out on work duties so I basically only needed the room in the evenings. There was no towel, no water, nothing. I asked for wifi and I was told the password would be brought to me. How? Nothing actually came. My first night I tried taking a bath and I realised the water leaked into the bedroom. Idk how but it goes into the drain and reappears under the sink into the bedroom. There were no floor mats nor towels like I earlier said. I think my room wasn’t made up after the previous occupant. So I go to the reception to make a complaint. I’m told they can’t change the room for me tonight because the manager isn’t available. Okay. No problem. So what do I do now? She says she’ll get someone to come clean the room and then get a plumber the next day to check it out. After waiting for close to two hours, guess who shows up at my door. The receptionist herself with a mop and bucket.
I’m too tired at this point to complain. She said she’d bring rugs after mopping. The rugs never came. The next day I return, and my room hadn’t been cleaned. No housekeeping, nothing. The bathroom is still leaking. I go back to complain and the new guy at the reception looks lost.
Once again he says my room can’t be changed. After another 3 hours or so this guy brings rugs. So my room is semi flooded. I can’t take a bath. And my sheets are still old. No towels no drinking water. Nothing.
At this point I gave up and slept because I was exhausted.
Another thing. I asked about the pool which looked visibly dirty. They said it would be cleaned soon.
That never happened. I left before my third night because I couldn’t deal with the bad service and room.
Once again. Beyond disappointed"

There was a used bar of soap in the shower (it had hairs from previous guests stuck on it), although they gave us a new one after requesting it. We got lost on our way to the hotel and tried calling the reception but no one picked the call; when we finally found the place and told the receptionist about that, he just replied that the number was wrong on the website and they had not changed it yet. There is no WiFi, when we asked the receptionist about it they said 'it was advertised on the internet but the reality was it was not there'. TV didn't work well and the toilet was not flushing. Although we had already decided not to have breakfast there due to the disgusting dirtiness of the place, they came to wake us up at 7.30 am to ask for our order... Positive points: the bed was big and comfortable and the a/c worked well, it is closed to Elmina castle.
When we book a cheap place like this we are not expecting any luxury, but at least cleanliness (especially in covid times!) and politeness, which we unfortunately didn't get in here."

He took us for a walk through town to see the lighthouse (which had an amazing veiw) and everyone in town knew him. ""Rasta Kobi!"" the children would yell as we passed them in the streets.
The bamboo hut is very rugged, the straw mattresses a little lope sided and pokey, but the sunrises, stars, ocean views, bonfire parties and conversations were beyond what I could have hoped for. I would love to go back some day."

It's affordable, cozy, and the best place to just relax and live a good life when at Cape Coast. The castle is situated right next to Bamboo village, so it's right in the centre of everything.

Genuinely recommend staying there, meeting Kobi and his dogs, enjoying some bonfire on the beach kn saturdays with music and drumming and just enjoying your life!!"

It's made of bamboo and it's very ""natural""
The doors of the toilet and the bathrooms have holes but it's something that you can manage
An experience that you have to try
It's on the beach and almost every night they light a fire on the shore and play reggae music
There's a good and quiet atmosphere where you can relax and rest
The owner, Kobi, is a very nice person
It's 25 cedis per night
It's very close to the Cape Coast castle so if you're coming from Accra with a bus, you will get down near a fueling station from where you can take a taxi to the Castle
The sea in front of the bamboo village is not swimmable even if some people go and swim anyway
If you go to Cape Coast and you're looking for a cheap and easy place you should go there and enjoy the amazing view from the veranda(where you can sleep but be careful for the mosquitos)"

2759,"Super welcoming place to relax and experience the magic of Cape Coast area.  Kobi is the best host., and the Saturday night fire and drumming on the beach not to be missed... a real delight."
2760,"This place felt like home during my stay in Ghana.
The guests and Kobi are like a familly here, sharing everything, eating together, doing shopping for dinner.
All in all a great place on the beach to feel relaxed and enjoy.
And Kobi is impossible not to love, he is a host honestly interested in your well being, and not only the money.
Thank you, brother!"

2765,"Thank you Kobi. My son Apollo haven't stopped talking about you. Asked what he liked most about Ghana and he would say ""the bamboo village ."" Staying  at your place was a very awaking experience. The peace, kindness and generosity was perfect."
2766,The owner kobi was awesome. I loved the beach and hearing the ocean waves when I slept. The others guest were very nice. I loved it
2767,Very relaxed and cool atmosphere with people from all walks of life. The naturally built beds are comfortable and the food is also one of the best vegetarian options in Ghana. This place feels like a home and the host has a joyful attitude about life that is contagious. I highly recommend this place for anyone coming to the Cape Coast area!
2768,"Spent all together 7 days. Great place right at the beach. Owner Kobe will make sure you are always feel welcome. They can cook food for you, they have cold drinks and all together its very nice place to stay at."

Be aware of the noise levels across this area the hill alone has 4 CHURCHES! No WiFi service was available while I visited during April 23 - 28, 2019.

Also this space is rented out for weddings. What an awesome little spot for the price."

They even accommodated our request for early check in and helped us arrange a driver for our entire stay. Would recommend this classy hotel to anyone looking for a romantic getaway.

When I returned in the evening, they were unable to provide dinner.Despite having 6 hrs to make arrangements they still still didn’t have any  food…  but they did manage to go out and stock up with beer!
My room didn’t have any towels and neither the a/c or tv worked. Nor did the sockets in my room.
The absolute icing on the cake was the total apathy of the staff who were sitting around on their phones or watching football. When I complained to the manager he simply laughed.
I say this - not as a privileged westerner - but as someone who has lived in Ghana for a number of years  ….AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS. IT IS A DISASTER. Marks out of 10 - zero.
Update - 18 hrs after checking in 2 power cuts and one separate cut in water supply. All of which took several hours to remedy as they don’t have a back up generator."

Not worth it for the price. This is not a hotel. Its an overated guest house.

3333,"Coming from London arriving to Cape Coast with a long 6 hour in traffic drive. We came in before 2 pm and we knew that that check in was at 2 so we waited until it was time to check in. The place was very nice when we arrived, very spacious and clean however once went to check in they said the room is still not ready.
So we decided to eat, so we ordered and the waiter said it would take 25mins. But 25 mins afterwards food and drinks haven't arrived yet. After 5 mins we got our drinks then about another 10 to 15 mins we got only 2 of our meals. The pizza tastes good but there was an overuse of flour at the base and I had to scrap it off with a knife. Then 10 mins afterwards the rest of the food arrived. The burger wasn't just a beef burger it was corned beef and mince which wasn't right but the tilapia was fine. We finished eating around 4 and still our rooms weren't ready. Then we went to investigate why our rooms weren't ready, after we made a fuss about why our rooms were taking so long we then guided to our rooms.Also the bathroom had a werid smell which was like they used bad cleaning products 😐 The customer service wasn't great at all.

So I came back again, on behalf of my grandfather wanting to treat us. And on the 26th Match 2023 there's a buffet. The jollof was good as well as the fried rice. Snapper was lovely. The fish and snail soup was alright however the fufu wasn't very nice. I would say the food is way better than last time but still there's a bit of improvement they can do. The dessert bar could have more options
The fresh bread would be more pleasant if it was warm.
It would be better to have more of a variety with the food and to be lenient with the spices as if people from aboard visit it would be hard for them to enjoy the meals.
The Victoria sandwich just isn't right at all
The pineapples were nice and sweet
The puddings are nice and creamy,l
The tarlet was alright could of been better
Overall, it's way better than before"

3342,"I love everything about this establishment!! The day after I arrived at Cape Coast, I called this hotel because I didn't like the Airbnb(s) I reserved. This hotel was my third move & the third time was the charm!!! 😌 They were even able to send a car to pick me up from the Airbnb to take me to the hotel.

The receptionist was extremely helpful my entire stay!!!! I stayed for seven days & enjoyed myself immensely. The receptionist even worked it out where I didn't have to move out on the night that they were fully booked👏🏾👏🏾

The room was amazing & the food at the restaurant was ON POINT‼️ Perfect place to stay when visiting Cape Coast for sure!! ALL of the staff was WONDERFUL!! I spent a lot of $ in tips while staying here because the service all around was absolutely perfect 💯‼️

The free breakfast is a great introduction to Ghanaian foods. You have the option to eat at the buffet every day, all day, but you also have the option of ordering from their menu. I only ate the breakfast buffet & ordered from the menu the rest of the day. Their sandwiches are to die for!! 😋🤤 The only criticism I have about ordering from the menu is the consistency of the dishes. For instance, I ordered the Tuna Sandwich two days in a row, but they were COMPLETELY different each time 🤔. Both were so good tho LOL

This will forever be my go-to hotel while in Cape Coast, hands down!!!"

3425,"I really enjoyed my recent visit to this serene coastal retreat. Got to experience some real peace and quiet.

The serene oasis, where the sea and sky meet in an endless display of beauty, truly captivated my heart. I could spend the whole day just admiring the beautiful seaside.

Despite a few hiccups with customer service, my overall experience was nothing short of amazing. I do suggest that they respond faster to visitors' needs.

And the food? Whaaattt!! it was absolutely delicious, although it may be a bit on the pricey side.

But here's a pro tip - make sure to bring a friend with you if you want to capture some stunning photos of yourself! Trust me, the strangers around just can't seem to get the right angles. Don't risk going home with no good pictures of yourself - bring a friend and snap away!

3457,"/!\ Malgré un bon séjour, j'ai décidé de mettre 3 étoiles pour ceci :

Nous avions réservé une chambre à 600ghs la nuit via un interlocuteur whatsapp. Arrivé sur place, nous découvrons que le prix de la chambre a augmenté, passant à 650ghs. Après explications il s'avère que c'est une erreur de la personne avec qui nous avons discuté, qui nous aurait envoyé les anciens tarifs. Donc ce n'est pas de notre faute... Et pourtant nous en avons payé les conséquences. Car au final nous avons dû payer le surplus. Aucune réduction n'a été proposé de leur part, ni même un cocktail de bienvenu ou autre afin de s'excuser de l'erreur ou de la gêne occasionnée... Alors oui, je ne suis pas à 50ghs près, mais la méthode est discutable. Je ne trouve pas cela correct d'être mis devant le fait accompli après 4h30 de route et de voir que la direction de l'hôtel n'assume pas son erreur. Dommage.

Pour le reste :

- idéalement placé, à 2 pas du CAPE COAST Castle, et accès directement à la plage. PLAGE ET OCEAN PROPRE (attention au courant qui est fort)
- chambre spacieuse et propre (ne pas être regardant sur les finitions mais ça fait largement l'affaire)
- personnel accueillant, arrangeant, agréable et discret
- nourriture excellente et choix varié
- parking privé et safe

Nous avons passé un agréable séjour malgré le désagrément cité plus haut."

Das Restaurant bietet gute Pizza und langsamen Service. Die Musik ist unangenehm laut (im Restaurant und an der Strandbar). Wenn man Getränke am Strand bestellt, dann ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, dass das überhaupt nicht kommt.
Vor Ort gibt es eine Billardplatte, aber keine Queues und Bälle. Wir konnten Tischtennis und Beachvolleyball spielen. Vor dem Hotel gibt es einen Basketballplatz.

Die Location ist optimal: direkte Nähe zum Meer und zum Cape Coast Castle. Bei der Rezeption kann man sich einen Taxifahrer buchen, der einen in den Kakum-Nationalpark bringt und dort auch wartet (450 Cedi haben wird gezahlt)."

The food was delicious, the chef Mr. Brown is amazing! Breakfast is huge portioned. Prices for drinks overpriced though.

The food is good and the staff are ready to assist anyway they can. You don't need to go and spend an arm and leg anywhere if what you need is a decent room, good food and a waterfront where you can enjoy with your party or friend.

3775,"Many will question why triangle? This isn't some sort of ""shape"" but a Hotel located at Allaye in Ho opposite the Estate. This place has rooms to guests, bar to serving you with all the non alcoholic  and alcoholic drinks beverages. If you probably looking for a low key but private leisure spent out of sight I think this the place. The rooms are comfortable to give you the warmth in the body. It's also open for all social gatherings; weddings, outdoring, funerals. The outdoor nature of serenity with great security checks and protection. Be there!"
3776,Super comfortable serene atmosphere. Budget lodging and great food 👌
3777,Great
3778,Perfect location for relaxing and an overnight stay. Poor service delivery. Moody staffs and difficulty in clearly understanding simple English. Leaking taps and room flooded in the night 🤔.
3779,Jean is an excellent host. Our hike to the Kulugu waterfall was amazing. Lovely to stay at a Ghanaian owned lodge. The food portions were big. Jean knows his way around and is an expert at arranging transport for you for fair prices! The rooms are a little outdated but the bed was the first soft bed I had in Ghana! It’s definitely a lovely serene place that I would highly recommend visiting

3785,"Really paradise in the mountains. Loved the experience there, from the greenery to the atmosphere and quiet. The rooms could use a little bit of 'pimping'.

Got there a bit late and woke up to the sunrise but unfortunately there was a thick fog. We instead got a nice breakfast with mountain view and drizzle.

The atmosphere is really nice and it's a must visit. The monkeys add a touch to the place."

3787,Best Adventure Spot up in the mountain.   Off grid Activated
3788,Great
3789,I still think the whole departments need to improve or be updated..from rooms to its bedsheet and whatever service is outdated and needs renovation....food has to improve...the water doesn't flow well..but you can't take away the guys there trying to make you feel at home...and the serene environment is still in place to make you feel at home...but yes they have to update the place to look better way forward..
3790,Best place to enjoy.. but the price of food is little expensive.
3791,Overpriced for price quality. Tap in bathroom leaking and making noice all night. Also very hard mattress. Manager not available for complaints. Otherwise nice environment with great views and good food
3792,Really a mountainous environment
3793,"It’s a paradise indeed. Breathtaking view of Gemi and Amedzofe. The least I say the better. Go explore the surroundings , The organic food here is not bad at all, with early morning lemon grass tea."
3794,It was very great and nice
3795,"The most serene place I have visited in the southern part of Ghana yet. The beautiful country side drive up the mountains, the trees, chirping birds, even the air you're breathing in feels different over there. Hosts are ever smiling and friendly, ready to provide information and allow you to explore freely.
Had their grilled chicken with sautéed veggies and it was nice (a bit dry though). Little fluffy kittens to keep you company while you eat in the open.
Was a short stop over and couldn't  sleepover but will definitely plan on  a return as rooms are affordable and within budget.
I loved loved loved every bit of it."

3797,"Though the place was unkempt(dusty T.V and tiles, smelling washrooms, dirty bedsheets) i was willing to wait for them to clean up the place but their customer care was very poor, they even said “you were stressing us with your calls”. I just had to leave because they didn’t want to admit their faults. I think you should employ qualified people to run the place. Thank you"
3798,"This lodge is the gate to a beautiful environment you can discover hiking with a close by waterfall and mountain trail; food is all organic and delicious while enjoying a view into the valley and ridge of mountains; the owner and staff are offering a all peaceful experience; it is simple place with all you need (warm water, AC if you want and power)"
3799,A cool place to rest
3800,"Wat ooit begon als een zwaar verwaarloosd government guesthouse 15 jaar geleden wordt dankzij de eigenaar die er altijd is elk jaar beter. Gewoon een heerlijke rustige plek die toen aan een onverhard bergpad lag, maar nu aan een goed verharde doorgaande weg. Het eten is prima, de kamers ook, maar nog met een beetje charme van lang vervlogen tijden. Gewoon een heerlijke rustige plek waar je lekker niets kunt doen."
3801,"The nature is amazing and the facilities are good for backpackers. But the stuff is overwhelmed with managing a little group. For example our breakfast, we ordered on evening before for 7:30 a.m., started 8:30 a.m. and the last of 8 meals arrived at 9:00 a.m.
For everything you have to pay extra. My advice never ask for the way to the waterfall. You have to pay 20 GHS per person for giving you the advice where the footpath starts. It is at the entrance road on left side. The owner confirmed that the fresh air is still for free  After 30 min you can arrive at a nice waterfall with pool. The upper pool has a very slippery entrance. Keep one person of your group outside to bring help in emergency case."

3809,nan
3810,"Let me first say: The location is cosy and the view is simply amazing. But there a a few aspects, that I you have to consider before you book a room there. We were welcomed in a way, that was different from the ghanaian hospitality we are used to. It seems like making money is the main focus. The hygiene of the rooms stands in no relation to the high price compared to other apartments in the area. Due to the potential of the accommodation we really hope that the situation will improve. Kind regards, Marius"

The service here was quite good. The waitress was very active and friendly. The only problem I had was that the food delayed quite a bit.

The place is still developing as at the time I went there as there was still construction being done around. You can either sit under a tree or sit under a shed and enjoy your meal.

The meal was just ok in my opinion. I had goat light soup as a starter and then had plain rice, sauce and grilled pork as a meal.

In terms of parking, there is ample parking space.

They also have a guest house where you can stay.

If you are in Ho, and you need a place to hang out with friends, this is the spot for you."

Food is prepared from fresh agricultural produce grown on the park and fresh meat 🥩 or fish from the pond or dam!

ACCOMMODATION is available and mostly have to be booked in advance as it's mostly in high demand!

A small yet cozy spot surrounded by islands, the beautiful sea and skies.
I ordered their banku and grilled barracuda which was huge and tasty.
I loved the views of the sea from their outdoor restaurant and definitely loved the boat counter (it was definitely a work of art)
The food came out in under 15mins and was a lil pricey compared to what you’ll get in Accra.
Overall experience 6/10"
4161,Very poor reception. Passed through reception area without seeing anyone to make enquiry from. Got to river front bar and requested for a beer and it took forever to come. Left there in anger. Won't recommend here to anyone.

4186,"Ada is one of the many coastal towns in the Greater Accra region with many beach rental homes and home to the Ghana Sailing Club.

Aside visiting the Tsarley Korpey Beach Resort you can visit other resorts around it

I mostly visit historical sites so this is new to me plus what better way to start the year than trying new things right? Tsarley Korpey Beach Resort was on last year’s travel plan but I could not visit due to my busy schedules. It is one of the many beach resorts in big Ada and famous for its beach front view. As we left home all I had in mind was ‘relaxation’ and enjoying sweet coconut juice..

At the last stop, you can either walk to the location with the help of a Google map or get on a motor bike for 3 cedis. I opted for the motor ride because I had no energy to walk, I had nothing in my stomach and feared the worst if I trek.

The Tsarley Kporpyi Beach Resort is a cute place with a calming aura, your ideal place to escape from your worries by just starring into the sea and listening to it move. The pool is side is spacious enough for a small group and it has poolside seats for you to relax on.

At the beach resort, you get a look at treasure island, one of the famous resorts and recreational sites in the country. Again, they have speed boats or cruise boats for small groups at a very affordable price at the resort. TSARLEY KORPEY BEACH RESORT, A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT IN ADA.

Perhaps my dislike at the beach resort will be their conference like seats, they looked worn out and very uncomfortable. And also, the tables, you will have to lean in to eat. There were few seats available at tsarley kporpyi and also there was a group having a get together which meant we had to be moved to a different seating area. The washroom at the beach resort is neat.

We ordered fried rice with grilled chicken and jollof rice also with grilled chicken. The food did not take long to be served and it tasted good and the quantity was enough.

A plate went for 45 cedi which is average as compared to most restaurants.

Facilities Available

Outdoor Pool,
Restaurant.
Bar.
Boat Riding / Canoe.

Good music accompanied with good food and company got me enjoying myself. We stayed for over 2 hours and had to set off to beat the traffic on the Tema road. TSARLEY KORPEY BEACH RESORT, A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT IN ADA.

In all I recommend the place to everyone, you will enjoy your stay. The beach resort is under construction so do not worry if it does not meet your expectations. I for one will visit soon when construction is completed.

I suggest comfortable seats be replaced in the meantime as they are under construction. Aside from that, I do recommend this destination especially for video commercials and photoshoot. A day well spent at TSARLEY KORPEY BEACH RESORT, A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT IN ADA."

I asked for wifi at the bar and was told to go to reception. I went to reception and was told only guests staying at the resort could have access. I told them I was there for the day would be having lunch, using the pool and bar but she still refused. In the end she said I would need to pay for it.

From the room to the restaurant it was terrible. The staff was not receptive, especially a gentleman that works in the restaurant. Every morning, the food was late and they were not bothered. If you order from the restaurant, you wait  for a very long time before you get your food. I will not recommend anyone to lodge at Freedom Hotel!!"

All rooms have hot tubs but the intercom in the rooms don't work so you will need to use your mobile phone to call the reception if you need any service or walk out to the reception or bar to ask for service.

A call to the reception, followed by a trip to the reception, followed by a promise to supply a towel, followed by more than one hour of waiting and another trip to the reception demanding to talk to the manager. Only then did a receptionist pick a towel from the adjoining room for me. I find this poor level of service quite unacceptable for the amount of money i paid.

The tilapia for the banku looks small and there are no telephones/intercoms in some of the rooms so from the 3 floor you have to walk down to ask for a bottle of water.

4919,"We stayed in the basic room, which is a lot cheaper than the other rooms but is also actually in a different building, which looks to be under construction for the last couple of years. It’s a good value for what you pay, especially since you have access to the hotels pool area, as well as the outdoor dining area and breakfast is included. On a negative note, the were multiple dead cockroaches in our room. Furthermore the toilet was leaking and the A/c was not adjustable.
The breakfast is more of a Ghanaian type.
The staff is friendly and helpful.
Also there is a beach with umbrellas in front of the hotel."

4924,"Aborigine Beach resort Food and Beverage team especially the waiters are very rude , their standard of grooming is gross 🤮”most of their wait staff and bartender were in either in a sandals or Slides “ waiters are poor at service  . They walk around like there is nothing at stake . Upon arrival I  didn’t see any waiting staff or a host welcoming me and offering me a seat . A waiter called Moses presented a menu on  our table like he was delivering food in a livestock farm ,he unapologetically went back to the bar . Our starter which he said it would be ready in 25 mins was ready in an hour and half , our waiter was a very rude to us . During the time we made our minds up to order for our main meal we called him to place an order he remorselessly said he is serving their CEO so he can’t attend to us he will send another waiter to attend to us “according to their hotel service policy you can’t be serving other tables as a wait staff when you are serving the  CEO “ just listed to this hotel service policy  that’s gross 🤮 . We sent One young waitress “a lady with short hair “ to call him back for us he never came . We again asked the lady  to call us their manager , a supervisor came to us and posed as a manger to plead on his behalf. The supervisor was poorly groomed if look on his shoes you can’t even finish your food sweating like an ice out of the fridge , so we were served our main dish by the waitress and she was so good at her service. Also I never saw a life guard at the swimming pool area ,bar tender very unprofessional  ,  the cocktails we had was poorly garnished with the head part and bottom of an orange 😂an you imagine the gross. The resort is very serene place with nice ambiance , aesthetically beautiful environment , security  service was very poor at the main entrance . Washroom had an awful smell one of the water closest left unclean after use “eww💩”  PSA ; Resort management should revisit their hotel policies and also train their staff on guests experience topics , guest service delivery and other hospitality trainings . *****Value for money not achieved  never visiting back*****"

I don’t think it qualifies for a beach resort.
I looks more like a guest house.
On arrival we ordered for beans with plantain which we didn’t get.
Our second order which was banku with Grilled tilapia wasn’t also available.
Instead of Grilled we were served with fried tilapia.
For dinner we wanted potato chips that wasn’t available as well.

No towels in the room
Water heater wasn’t working well
The IP phone in the room wasn’t working .

There was no value for money."

4962,Serene space to take it easy. They have an NGO school and I’d love for people to find ways to help. It’s a community base eco resort. Ttheir food is really delicious and healthy. Ten out of ten experience I will always rate their customer service as well.

I will be recommending Meet Me There to my friends!"
4965,"We spent two nights here and the experience was therapeutic. It’s a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
Very natural and Afrocentric lodge. I love the serene and calm atmosphere. Rooms are very beautiful and aesthetically appealing with the view of the lagoon. Customer service was excellent especially Collins, he was marvelous.
We sent our pet along and they were very sweet and welcoming. Not all resorts are pet-friendly but they stood out.
Foods and drinks were great with very moderate prices. However, it would be nice if they added more food options to the menu.
They have a spa and yoga sessions 😅
Cheers to them for providing a learning center and a whole library for the community.
Parking space is not a problem.
Please do well to book way ahead of time since the place is always fully booked including future reservations."
4966,I can only begin this with the food .. wow you all must try it.. the meals were amazing and very culturally oriented. 2 nights here was definitely worth it. I had a massage which sent me to the other moon.. very therapeutic. Make sure you also join the morning yoga exercise as well. You can enjoy the ocean and the lagoon as well. Customer service is top notch.. professional staff only especially James. This is an eco friendly lodge so make sure you prepare as such. I was however surprised we had to pay for breakfast.. in fact this is the only hotel I have stayed in Ghana that required that .. I hope in future they work that coz it really catapulted our bills. In all here is a sure 85% experience.
4967,This is actually our second time here. If you want to escape the city and close to nature? Don’t think twice perfect place. The staff 👌the food is good and fresh.
4968,Der Ort ist wunderschön und das Essen ist fantastisch! Die Gastfreundschaft der Angestellten ist auch einmalig. Wir haben uns hier extrem wohl gefühlt. Falls wir nochmal in Ghana sind ist das Meet me there definitiv ein Ziel!

4974,"One of the best resorts in Ghana and a personal favourite, gives a homely feel but a therapeutic atmosphere.

Everything was a 10/10 from the staff to the food to the rooms , which makes up for the long wait to book.

You need to book some months ahead to be able to get your preferred room as MMT is a hot cake.

And the lovely part of all this how the money from the resort goes back to charity and improving the lives of the community, this makes every money you spend here worthwhile.

Will recommend MMT to everyone."
4975,"I really enjoyed my stay there, the food taste was exceptional and I can't wait to go back again for another vacation."
4976,"The stuff makes too many errors on a permanent basis e.g. getting a simple order wrong and forgetting to prepare your dinner. This is crucial if you have to pre-order 2 hours in advance.

The thing that bothered me the most, however is their payment structure. Hidden fees or errors on a permanent basis. Charged me too much for laundry service and even charged extra for accommodation even though I had clearly received upgrades at their courtesy.

The facility itself needs proper maintenance. Especially the Hoenymoon Suite is everything but pleasant. The toilets... jeeeez... scary to sit on em.

All in all I have to say that I leave this place with a feeling as being cheated on. Thx to the manager..."

The lodge is absolutely beautiful-  I recommend booking the sunrise or sunsets suites if they are available (they have a private porch and direct access to the lagoon - not to mention a beautiful outdoor shower.) The food is delicious - the coconut fried rice is my favorite, but you can't go with anything on the menu. The staff are welcoming - shout out to Frank and his great hospitality. I can't say enough good things about MMT and recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing stay.  It's about a 3.5 hour drive from Accra (depending on traffic in Tema). Also, don't forget to book a massage!"

As soon as I arrived, I didn't want to go back 😍
I had a lovely stay!

😌The place is quiet and very soothing.
Everything you need to relax and forget about the noise, bustle and polluted air of Accra😅

🛏: Very nice room between 230 and 460 GHS per night. I was a bit septic with the eco toilet but I admit it didn't bother me at all .
And the outdoor shower 😍😍 It was just the dream .

🥗The food is 🥹🤤🤤😍.
Breakfast can be taken at any time but it is suggested to order lunch and dinner 2h in advance .

🏝 _You have a lagoon to swim in all day if you wish.
_There is also a canoe that you can use to get to the beach for free.
💆🏾‍♀️For 150 GHS, you can treat yourself to a Swedish or deep tissue massage.
I really needed it, believe me.
It's worth it!

The service was just perfect with responsive staff, I will definitely go back.
I would recommend this place 100%

⚠️It is in high demand, so book quickly when there is a room available

⚠️ The rate of the rooms will change in August

⚠️ please bring a mosquito repellent. Mosquitoes 🦟 are nothing ordinary over there😂😂 They are seriously aggressive 🤣
📌Don’t worry, you have a spray for your room. You need the repellent when you are outside"

This place is the real definition of toxic people. It’s a place l have lodged years back, so when I came back with some few friends after almost 2hours drive to Dzita, I thought  they will definitely have something to say when they go back to their country. I faced the worse embarrassment. Not even my plea to at least serve my guess water was considered. Even if we made a mistake by not checking your updated policies, management should be a bit considerate when we plead. 0 star."

Koodos to their 👨‍🍳...we ate all the prawns & tilapia we could.  We were even lucky to catch a tilapia harvest on our last day. Zero mosquitoes people! Zero! So much cross-ventilation, airyness, and lightness to this resort.

Highly recommended!"

Mind you, from my experiences, customer service is mostly a challenge here in Ghana (no pun intended). Management and staff were super friendly, professional, caring and very responsive. Talk about cleanliness and you have a very prestine, super clean resort that is quiet and actually therapeutic; At least for some of us who enjoys being in a very cozy, relaxing, quiet and private environment. My utmost respect to the owners of this resort for their vision and professionalism. Keep up with the awesome work you're already executing. My family will continue to visit and enjoy this paradise😊"
5028,"Villa Awoyo is a lovely lakeside resort with superb ambience for guest seeking privacy. The place has a lovely playground for kids to have lots of fun for family with kids  but can get boring if its a couple with no kids. During our stay, the pool was dirty hence not  much fun for adults except the lake side view.

Meals at the Villa Awoyo deserve  all the compliment because it is really great. However,  for breakfast  we observed it was not as good as lunch and dinner.  Villa Awoyo should revisit pricing of meals and drinks due to their stern terms and conditions of not allowing guests to bring in drinks and food.

Rooms at Villa Awoyo are small but quite pricey given that their rooms dont come with a  mini tea bar where guests can easily have tea or coffee at their convenience which is a standard for most resort. NB: we lodged in their executive room."

From the minute we drove through the giant gates of Villa Awoyo, we were drawn to the sky-blue water in the immaculate swimming pool, as well as the expansive playground featuring a basketball court, tennis court, swings, slides, playground climbers, see-saws, merry-go-rounds, and tubes. Nature is prevalent at Villa Awoyo with  two river decks directly on the the banks of the Volta River, and a fish nursery adjacent to the river decks !

The food at Villa Awoyo was delectable and incredibly well-prepared and presented ! The menu was expansive enough to cater to everyone in our group which included 2 young families (with 5 kids from ages 7 years to 1 year) and a vegan grandma. The service was quick, professional, and very respectful.

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Villa Awoyo and greatly look forward to my next visit !"

It is a also a good place when you are attending a funeral around the South Tongu District and want a place to spend the night. They have budget rooms, restaurant and bar.

5092,"First of all, we drove over 3 hrs from Accra to this place and wasn’t even offered a welcome drink. The amenities are so scattered. Our room was on one side and the pool, mini golf, tennis, etc was on another side where you can access by using an overpass. There’s a community path in between the reception, activity area and the restaurant and river view rooms. The buffet food was terrible. Mind you we paid for a full board and still had to order meals and pay for them. It was like living in a boarding house (If you don’t like what is served, there’s no other option). I even walked in on another customer complaining bitterly about his son being unable to eat anything from their kitchen. The only juice served at breakfast was processed mango. If you don’t take mango, literally go to hell 😂. The place looks really good in pictures and videos but very different irl. Their service is terrible. We kept asking for access to WiFi but never received it till our last day and it didn’t even work. The manager (Ernest) will listen to your concerns and tell you he understands your frustrations but nothing changes. I’m guessing it’s beyond his capabilities. You should have seen the shock I had when I found out there was a graveyard inside the place - pictures attached (not very far from the kitchen). After talking to some staff, I found out the whole place used to be a cemetery prior to the resort being built. That’s where my struggle to sleep began ( We had intended to do 3 nights but left after the second night).
I must say though that I enjoyed the river activities. Had a great time kayaking and enjoyed the boat ride.
The manager promised me pineapple juice after I expressed my concerns about mango being the only juice available, only for them to serve me fermented pineapple and ginger juice which upset my stomach after just a little sip. I’m never going back here and will not recommend it to anyone. You’re better off spending your money elsewhere or treating yourself at home."

5116,"Desastrosa estadía, fuimos en grupo de amigos por el día de los padres y peor no pudo ser
Llegamos y las cabañas que se nos dio no eran como habíamos solicitado previamente
Quisimos bañarnos en la piscina y estaba sucia y sin atención ninguna y cuando nos vieron allí quisieron sacarnos de mala forma porque no estaba apta sin señalizacion alguna que lo prohibiera o alguien que previamente lo advirtiera
La WiFi nunca funciono y el servicio del restaurante muy malo hasta olvidaron una de las órdenes
Decidimos que nunca más volveremos allí y mucho menos recomendaremos el lugar a nadie"
5117,Nice place to go have fun with friends and family 🤠
5118,"Totally love this get away place by a lake. Kind of different from other get aways. I love the way their diner is actually built in a such a way that a portion is it is into the lake.

Rooms a small but cozy and comfortable. There are many recreational activities there that can keep you active for your time there"
5119,"My friends and I had great fun, from boat ride to golf ⛳, then volleyball 🏐 and ended our day with swimming 🏊, not forgetting bonfire night with music. the place is very spacious to have your small get together and stuff. Location was great but food delayed for over an hour."
5120,"This place will be worth your while... Wow amazing staff and lots of fun activities. I mean lots of it⚽️🏐🎲🚣‍♀️🛶🛥🏊. Dope room😍. After all the fun, it'll take you a whole lot of time waiting for your meals. I understand the kitchen is understaffed. If that can be worked on then it'll get all 5 stars. It's a definitely a ""see you soon"" for me than a ""good bye""."
5121,"The food here is a hit or miss, on the same day after ordering one back and okro that was nice, two more orders of banku and okro were so oily they had to pour the oil ontop out. The crab in one was like a stone. The food inconsistency has been an issue every visit.
The other items bought were good.

The paddle boat was faulty but the kayaks were great. If you are in a large group the boat tour is a great value for the price.

The salads on the plates were attacked by these tiny black flies making it very hard to eat on the beach front, not sure if there’s anything they can do about them though but just be prepared to deal with those pests.

The rooms are nice.

I’ve been there prior to them opening, when they opened and now, it’s nice to see all the expansion and developments.

Will have to go back and play golf and swim."
5122,"This place is beautiful!!!! Really beautiful and neat. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and they serve really nice foods too."
5123,Very loving place for vacation.
5124,"The place is beautiful and full of nature but the service is bad. The swimming pool was very dirty without water exchange system, no one come around to attend us for about 2 hrs after that we went to complain to the reception, no towels were provided, there is nothing to drink or eat around the swimming pool. The standard room were clean. The time to eat was another disappointment because we requested for pepper free food and looked like we requested double pepper instead, at the end was imposible to swallow it, in addition they forgot one of the food of our friend. The time to pay was another story because the prices on the bill were no the one on the menu, the person Incharge said that the prices were increased but not changed on the menu but was not informed to us before the order. Really we decided not to go again. Sorry but we had a very bad experience."
5125,"Fun fun fun. A place you can go with family, friends and groups. Food is on point. Swimming pool, Boat ride, pedallor, kayaking are available. I love the restaurant on the river front with good music in the background. Workers are polite and friendly. This is the pride of Volta related to fun"

Booked by hubby for my 55th Bday with friends and family.  Though they initially corked up with de booking , it turned out well in de end.
Only downside were: Checkin was very late; 5 instead of 2pm, no internet in the chalets as advertised  and we weren't told while checking in so we could swap to to deluxe."

The food? Well, let's just say it's perfect for anyone on a diet - because you won't want to eat much of it.

5345,Would Not recommend this place. 1) inconvenient location so nothing really around that you can walk to. This makes it difficult when it comes to eating and finding food to eat. 2) facilities are sub par. Had to lug one of my suitcases up several flights of steps because I checked in late and no one could help. No elevators and each floor had windows open so it was very hot and humid outside your room. Room was clean but king room was very small like a box . Bathroom windows permanently open so the bathroom was extremely hot. Several windows not fully enclosed which led to me seeing large mosquitoes in the rooms. Ultimately ended up changing hotels due to discomfort with the mosquitoes  and they had no alternate rooms available. This hotel has potential but a long way to go. 1) elevators needed or staff to carry bags 24/7 2) ac Units in hallways 3) all windows need to be able to close fully and 4) if food is served menus should be readily available as there are no other restaurants in that close vicinity 5) face towels in all rooms
5346,Nice pool with cool music

5348,"While the overall atmosphere of the establishment was pleasant, the cleaning services were subpar.

It seemed as though the cleaners were not taking their duties seriously and were merely fulfilling a obligation rather than providing exceptional service.

It would be in the best interest of the management to address this issue in order to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction and prevent any further negative experiences."

They offered a breakfast buffet that was adequate. They offered toast, cereal,  fresh fruit, local food, and a British based items along tea, coffee  and juice.
My only complaint is the credit card machine didn't work upon check out, and I had to go to the ATM for cash. Other than that incident I would this place as a good place to stay."

5441,"Even though I haven't lodged at other hotels before, I want to assume that Urbano Hotel offers one of the best accomodations around Accra.

The best thing about this hotel: is that it isn't far from Kotoko International airport; that way, you can always meet up your flight schedules on time, and it offers you the opportunity to feel the pulse of the city, and a great sight to the hustle and bustle of Accra. Just step out of the hotel, and you are right where there are so many cars, motorcycles, hotels and businesses. Not to forget that several hotels are its neighbors, so you have as many options - just in case.

My favorite street to stroll is Osu street (cos there's a few local food being served as you walk along😂), plus, just somewhere around Osu street is the sister Hotel called Roots Hotels (I had dinner here with my colleagues at the roof top)."

5623,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Holiday Inn during my visit to Accra, Ghana. From the moment I stepped foot into the lobby, I was greeted with warm smiles and exceptional hospitality that continued throughout my entire stay. Without a doubt, this hotel has set the bar incredibly high for luxury accommodations.

The attention to detail is truly remarkable. Every aspect of the hotel, from its stunning architecture to the tastefully decorated interiors, exudes elegance and sophistication. The blend of contemporary design with subtle nods to local culture creates an atmosphere that is both inviting and enchanting.

My room was an absolute haven of comfort. The plush bedding, coupled with the panoramic views of the city skyline, made it difficult to leave the room each morning. The attention given to cleanliness and maintenance was exemplary, ensuring a pristine and relaxing environment throughout my stay.

One of the highlights of my experience was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. From the knowledgeable concierge who offered valuable local insights to the attentive housekeeping staff who ensured my room was always immaculate, every member of the team went above and beyond to make my stay unforgettable.

Dining at Holiday Inn was a culinary journey in itself. The diverse range of restaurants and bars within the hotel offered a multitude of options, each presenting delectable dishes crafted by talented chefs. The blend of international cuisine and local flavors tantalized my taste buds, leaving me craving more with each meal.

Additionally, the hotel's amenities were second to none. The state-of-the-art fitness center provided a comprehensive array of equipment, allowing me to maintain my workout routine. The luxurious spa offered a tranquil escape, where I indulged in rejuvenating treatments that left me feeling completely pampered.

The location of the Holiday Inn was ideal, situated in the heart of the city with convenient access to major attractions, shopping districts, and vibrant nightlife. Whether I wanted to explore the cultural landmarks or simply soak in the energy of the city, everything was within easy reach.

In conclusion, my stay at Holiday Inn was an exquisite experience that exceeded all expectations. The combination of opulence, impeccable service, and attention to detail truly sets this hotel apart. Whether you're traveling for business or leisure, I wholeheartedly recommend Holiday Inn for a remarkable stay that will leave you with memories to treasure for a lifetime.

The location is prime, the staff are professional, the infrastructure is modern, the bar is well stocked and there is ample sitting in the fore court area where every Saturday evening there is a live band session.

There's also a pool 5ft deep end. The location of the place right next to the beach is very scenic and great for beach lovers.

Finally for the night life lovers, the experience you'd get is worthwhile and unique. Definitely worth checking out."

5679,"Rooms are okay.
Receptionist will kill your business Mr. Manager.
A customer asked if you provide breakfast and all he could say was ""no but you can go to Mas*** Hotel, hope you know there""."
5680,"I will simply commend the efforts of a staff called SAKEY and the kitchen staff for their civil, welcoming and very polite conducts. I as well remember Freda, although she no more works there. Interestingly, the lovely conducts of these people kept me doing business with your hotel.
I have been lodging in your hotel since 2013 and with my tour consult, I have lodged several of my tourists from several countries, business partners, students, family and friends at your hotel...in the same vein, I have recommended your hotel to a decent number of people but it becomes really DISGRACEFUL to realise that your hotel has an UNCIVILISED, UNTRAINED, UNCOOKED, UNFRIENDLY, CRUEL and a VERY RUDE staff with the name RICHARD working there. Thus, I keep asking myself anytime I visit your hotel; if that boy ""RICHARD"" is there to CHASE AWAY your customers with his uncivilised conduct or purposely there just to FIGHT and INSULT every guest who comes to the Hotel...?
If your hotel really has a management, you must have gotten several unwelcoming reports from your guests about that boy ""RICHARD"". I have had several unbelievable encounters with him and I still wonder why the management of your hotel still harbours him... If you need to keep him to still work there, then it is the management's responsibility to school him properly to understand the nature of the business you run. He's been working there for years but obviously he is so daft not learn or at least to train himself for any further opportunities.
One can easily conclude that he has a problem within himself which he transfers to visitors of the hotel almost everytime...
You may have to note that, with such a bush boy, your hotel is never safe to host visitors..."

It had multiple outlets to charge my phone and other electronics, a tv, very cold refrigerator, a fan, and a beautiful balcony to look out at the pool. The staff were helpful and welcoming. The only set back is the bathroom could have been a tad cleaner. On the bright side, my room was cleaned each day and I stayed 5 nights. Still overall great experience and just 20 mins from the airport."

5741,It took 25 min to tjek in the problem was the rate was higher than they own homepage. The did not paid back my balance. When i went to their restaurant the menu look good and also their pricing. But chef they hire can only make yellowrise and fried rice so very disappointing. The breakfast was surprisingly good egg. Saled with sausage. I did not get my oats as promised. In the room there is free coffee and tea but no cooker for boiling water. When i told them they did not bring it. The pool area was good. If the management step up their duty it could be a great hotel to visit as for now i only wanted to stay one night closd ny there are another hotel to half if their price witj good restaurant food

5877,"Really bad experience, it was my first time in Ghana, we went there with friends and even though they have security guys all over the place I got my phone stolen.
No one wanted to give us access to the video recording when I realised my phone was stolen and I was promised to be call back the next day by the manager.
I was never called and my friend has to call multiple times to remind them to get back to us.
When we finally had access to the recording I realised that the video was cut at the exact moment my phone was stolen and then everything was erased - the reason was that there was a power cut that explained the « not complete » video whereas I was there and there was no power cut (no light off, no music off).
Those people are liars, they actually covered the person who stole my phone and reading through the comment it appears that it did not happened to me only."
5878,"They steal phones there. Terrible customer service, no one helps"
5879,"Jumping on the ""stolen phone review"". Shame on the management of the beach for such a lack of accountability. Had to choose a star, wished there was less than 1X rating.
@owners of the place: recommend you pick up the phone, apologies and compensate for the theft"
5880,"I don't recommend at all.
My friend's phone was stolen, at a party there with at entrance fee. They deleted the part of the recording where it was happening which means it was probably done by someone from the staff. We followed up several times and they never even replied.
Security is hanging around with bullet-proof vest for nothing.
Very very poor customer experience."

Unfortunately we had to wait for a long time to get seats, eventually we did get seats . We placed orders for drinks and kebab and seafood pasta …now the wait time was extremely looonggg! We had to wait such a long time to get the drinks and food. Service at this place is terrible! We had to set up our own table…there were just alot of things that ruined the experience for us . We asked for the bill that also took a long time to come and when it eventually came ..an item that we didn’t order for (food platter) was added to our bill , we had to call the attention of the waiter to that as well , to correct the bill again involved another time of waiting. The only positive things from this experience were the cocktails, they were nice and the seafood pasta had the right amount of cream …away from all of these the quality of service here needs to be upped!!!!"

5937,"I think a lot has to be done in the hotel, water stops flowing time to time and you have to go out and call an attendant. Bedsheets are heavily stained and they used a duvet to cover the stained area.
The duvet or blanket smells very bad, like it's not been washed.
Management should seriously look into that, until they improve it's a no no for me.
Flask for breakfast is rusted, the cutter to open a milk was not washed. It was a horrible experience for me.
It's a no no."

6017,"I am celebrating end of my Ghana trip   with a champagne Afternoon Tea in The Court at the Number one Oxford street  Hotel. Which is West Africa Ritz luxurious style.

It is my  favorite place in Ghana; I loved the elegant ambiance and delicious food which is always exquisitely presented.

On this occasion, I am concerned as the doctor has placed me on a low FODMAP diet to address the food allergies and intolerances I am  currently suffering (including dairy, nut and gluten) In actual fact, I had no need to worry, my special dietary requirements were very well catered for. Apartments are luxurious Décor
an excellent choice for rest and rejuvenation. Well-known for its family-friendly environment and proximity to great restaurants and attractions, Number one Oxford makes it easy to enjoy the best of Accra.

As your “home away from home,” the boutique hotel rooms offer a flat screen TV, air conditioning, and a refrigerator, and getting online is easy, with free wifi available.

Guests have access to a 24 hour front desk, a concierge, and room service while staying at hotel In addition, Grand Number one offers breakfast, which will help make your Accra  trip additionally gratifying. And, as an added convenience, there is parking available to guests.

Highly recommend and will return."

6043,"Thus was my first time to stay at this Apartment hotel. What impressed me was the service of the staff. Very polite and very attentive to your needs. They are willing to go out of their way to ensure you are comfortable.

The rooms are actually small apartments so this means lots of fantastic space. They are modern and spacious and very well kept. The shower was a little on the small side but nothing to much to complain about. Oh yes the pressure from the shower could be better.

The breakfast was very good with a great choice of local dishes and pastries. Mixing you western and local culture very well. I never did dinner there purely because I wanted to explore the local restaurants and try authentic traditional foods.

My only small issue is the location. It's far from the Central Business District meaning that if you have meetings in the city then you need to leave 30 mins or more before the meeting due to the traffic. And likewise coming back can take a while due to traffic. Apart from that it's a great place to stay in Accra."

6059,"I just found out how to write reviews recently and I thought of writing one about my terrible experience at this hotel.
On the outside, the hotel looks very eye-catching and attracting but if you actually put time and money into going there you will realise that it was a bad decision.
When I visited, I was told the WiFi was down and to make matters  even worse,I wanted to watch some TV and I noticed there was no decoder. The TV was big but it wasn’t useful since I could only access satellite channels.
I didn’t have anything else to do, so I decided to take a dip in the pool, which was a terrible idea as the pool was dirty and filled with dead bugs and I saw that as a health hazard so I didn’t even bother going in.
The only good aspect of my stay was the food."

6064,"The ambience was great and the room was cosy. I was well received and certain the meals would have been great as well; just that my stay was overnight only.

But the bathroom shower door made it near impossible for me to get into the shower cubicle. A slimmer person could wangle through, unless they change the orientation of the door.

Other than that? It was worth the money spent. Clean, affordable, not too far from the airport, courteous and helpful staff, lovely ambience."

The staff are welcoming, especially at the front desk. The food quality at the restaurant is superb, I highly recommend the chicken alfredo and the burgers. The cappuccino they make is the best I've ever had.
The swimming pool is very clean and visually appealing, as is the gym and pool tables.
Massages are available to book also.
Even the most basic room comes with a fridge/freezer and kettle, and a fantastic shower. Rooms are very secure.
I will definitely be returning here on my next visit to Ghana.

The local bar was set up beautifully, the downside was the coconut’s were not properly opened hence making it quite hard to drink.   Their main meals were cooked to perfection. Asked a couple of people that tried different meals and it was a 10/10 for them.    I didn’t really try much of the desert.  But I liked the Oreo cake. I’d definitely recommend.   And big ups to the team that attended to us."

We were a party of 11 and our food started arriving after almost 1.5 hrs. My order, literally 1.45hrs later, arrived incorrect.  Another person of our party accepted my incorrect meal.  No explanation nor apology was offered.  Some locals from my group complained and suddenly anew and correct order arrived.  I give two stars because the fella finally apologized.

I was still charged $67 GHS so Im giving one star."

The rooms are air conditioned and offer a quiet place to sleep.

The rooms have a safe and fridge.

We were not given complimentary water even though they stated this was part of the package.

The wifi is very good at all places in the hotel.

6562,"Was travelling for business to Accra, on a friend’s recommendation chose to stay at the Lancaster Accra.

It was an excellent choice as compared to other hotels in the city this is not a tall skyscraper but rather a three-level hotel with tranquility and plenty of vast green spaces. In fact, a vast sanctuary with plenty of room to rest, relax and do business.
Ideal for the weary traveler looking for clam and peace this hotel is a resort with friendly staff from the reception to the housekeeping all greeting their guests with a smile. I chose this hotel the second time of my travel to Accra and was delightfully pleased with the consistency of the service.

The hotel has a large restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner with an impressive buffet and plenty of seating capacity both indoors and outdoors by the poolside. The restaurant serves both local and international cuisine with a variety of seafood options. Service and hospitality are impeccable in true Ghanian style. The staff are always smiling and ready to help with their guests’ special dietary requests.

The pool side has a bar that serves all kinds of alcoholic drinks and is a beautiful place to unwind in the evening with music from the ninety’s playing all night long and if one would like they can watch a game of football on the large TV screens outdoors.

The hotel has a shop that sells large paintings from their resident artist Mr. Kofinduro. His paintings are worth owning and Kofinduro himself is readily available to explain the meaning behind his painting. An always smiling humble gentleman, I’m putting up some of his work of art and his photo with his permission. Please do buy his paintings if you are an art lover and let his work of art adorn your home or office.

A special mention for Ms. Francisca at the restaurant who was ever smiling with a pleasant demeanor and ready to offer suggestion and accommodate by a-la-carte-request. A shout out to Ms. Linda from the reception for your impeccable service and all the housekeeping staff who readily greeted all their guests and tidied my room for me."

Customer service is terrible. They don't even pick up your calls. We got there at 7pm and were told there is no food because the kitchen has closed. At 7!! The bathroom for the ""King Suite"" had no running water and didn't even have a tub. In the end we had to pay for lodging at a different place and move.

Worst of all they didn't give a refund even though we booked for 2 nights and couldn't even sleep there for one night."

6751,"Starší, ale příjemný hotýlek na pobřeží Atlantiku. Z druhé strany rušná silnice, blízko centra Accry. Přiměřená cena - 500/1000 cedi za pokoj se snídaní. Snídaně bohaté a chutné, obsluha velmi milá. Nejedná se o nic luxusnoho, nicméně pokoj s velkým balkónem a výhledem na bouřící oceán opravdu stojí za to. V moři se kvůli nečistotě koupání nedoporučuje, ale mají zde poměrně prostorný a čistý bazén. V areálu je restaurace, kde velmi dobře vaří. Není zde běžně zvykem dávat na pokoje ručníky ani toaletní papír. Na požádání však přinesou 😊. Po tom co jsme viděli předtím za nás spokojenost. V hotelu je klimatizace."

6802,this hotel is Terrible . It is infested with cockroaches and the most expensive room had no running water. It is expected that you bath out of a bucket. The internet service is terrible and management refused to fix it. I had to move out early on a monthly and management is trying to hustle me out of the money in thinking that I would be leaving the country. I will try to contact corporate at a later time. The only good thing is the chef. But I don't think the food is sanitary because of  the amount of bugs. The hotel need to be torn down and rebuilt . It is a love motel at best. I had so many problems the staff became ashamed to me.
6803,"I was disappointed. Water was not flowing, cockroaches sharing the room with you. Wasn't worth the price."

Upřímně nechápu, jak je možné mít něco takového v nabídce bookingu. Pokoj s manželskou postelí bez přikrývky, kterou jednoduše nedisponují, odporný záchod se sprchovým koutem, voda netekla, zda by ji pustili jsme nezjistili. A přes dřevěný plot výhled na pláž plnou odpadků. Po 12 hodinovém letu velké zklamání. Naštěstí díky všudypřítomným taxíkům a výborně fungující službě Bolt se nám podařilo najít jiné ubytování."

6897,"I asked for the cheapest room so if course it was basic- you get what you pay for. (140ghs a night, marvellous) I should've brought my mosquito net- the bed was comfy but the pillows weren't, there isn't glass in the windows but there is mesh. (The mozzies must've come through the cracks in the door). The lock was just a wee padlock but I felt safe cos only the guests could get to that part anyway. There's a plug in fan & the view over the sea is amazing (though the amount of rubbish in Ghana breaks my heart). There were 2 shared toilets and bucket shower- it was fine. I don't think even the must expensive room has ac (but prob have their own bathrooms) but it's all good value. I loved the sounds of the waves and the birds singing. There are cats running about too. 😸 They also let me in rather late one night (I woke them up, sorry guys) & were nice about it. The food is veggie (and delicious) which was a nice surprise after Ghana's usual meat/fish heavy diet. I had forgotten what mushrooms look like! The place is in a really central handy location. I got taken (by friendly folk) to the art market and to Abajo arts centre and saw a local traditional band- it was really good. I also saw the Kake Dance Ensemble practicing- 65 children dancing, drumming, singing (original songs!) and doing the most fantastic circus acrobatics (over hard concrete! No-one fell!). Look them up & follow them on the socials. They practice at the Rising Phoenix 3 times a week.
All in all, it's an exciting, friendly, vibrant place."
6898,"There is no wifi, no running water, no A/C
No nothing.

The view is good. That is the only good thing in here, but lots of trashes are in the sea.

Also it is too hard to find the location. You have to pass through some dirty places to come.

It does not worth the price.
Pay little more and go other better place."

No tuvimos TV, ni WIFI ni A/C, ni baño en la habitación (otras sí tienen) pero ni falta que nos hizo. EL taxista no tenía ni idea de dónde estaba el hotel y nos perdimos. Al llegar de noche fue un poco desconcertante. A la mañana siguiente cuando salí de la habitación no daba crédito: las vistas al océano y al puerto de pescadores, y la arquitectura del hotel (mayormente de madera) eran como un sueño. De aspecto colonial, rodeado de vegetación y distribuido en diferentes ambientes para relajarse, comer, comprar algún recuerdo o disfrutar de un espectáculo en su mega escenario, no te da tiempo a aburrirte. También están los animales, gatos y gallinas que sin ser pesados te entretienen con sus juegos. Las ratas gigantes que se paseaban por el tejado los primeros días haciendo bastante ruido fueron capturadas, más que nada para cocinarlas. Hay que mencionar que nos ofrecieron probarlas (en broma). Buena música todo el día. El jefe nos atendió y fue muy amable con nosotros. Admito que fue un poco una aventura. Pero si sabes apreciar lo sencillo, el hotel es un lujo prácticamente regalado."

7033,"My stay here was amazing and the staff was warm and friendly during my entire stay. The hotel has a colonial style to it, a bit of an older property but they do a great job of maintaining it well. The pool, poolside bar, and poolside restaurant have a resort vibe to them. You also have a private beach out back for residents and it’s a short walk to local restaurants and bars. Yes, you can hear the music from the neighboring establishments, but if you didn’t google how accra likes to party and how Labadi beach area is a focal point for entertainment in the area then that is your fault in my opinion. If you’re on a real vacation, it won’t bother you much.  Unfortunately I got sick during my last 48 hours of my stay in Ghana and didn’t get a chance to enjoy Accra for all it was worth, but that is where the Labadi beach hotel staff really shined ! A few staff shout outs….

Mrs. Irene (House manager), an amazing lady who really took care of me when I was sick. She instructed the staff to do everything in their power to make me comfortable during my last day there when I wasn’t even sure if I could fly because of how sick I was. She had them make me a special soup, gave me liquids, and checked on me. She really is a wonderful person, and I can’t thank her enough for how she treated me. Most hotels would just want you out of their hair in that condition. She took care of me like I was her own son until I left for my flight.

Mrs. Linda, I believe this was Mrs. Irenes assistant manager? Either way, she was equally amazing and took care of me as well. Constantly checking on me and insuring I was accommodated with the food staff and instructed them to give me whatever I needed to recover.

Mrs. Abigail (Nurse at Hotel). Wow ! This lady is just wonderful. She came to my room and cared for me and checked on me, even having to walk around my throw up in my room to care for me. She was professional, sincere, and cared for me with the upmost standards of care. There was a moment where I was concerned I would have to go to the hospital and she could see that I really didn’t want to do that so she cared for me the best she could but I could tell that if I got worse she would make the call for me to go. That really comforted me knowing that she was fully aware of my situation and was in control professionally and medically of my wellbeing.

Ebenezer (Hotel Lobby Bar). This young man served me several times during my stay and even during the morning I was sick. He’s a great member of this staff. Attentive and responsive service. I appreciated him during my stay."

The staff were also offering great service. So much so that the chef personally took my order and made me exactly what my taste buds and stomach needed 😜

We loved it there....the reggae music next door helped set the vibe, and the beach setting was super relaxing....you could stay there all night! We returned two afternoons in a row.

Definitely worth a visit if you want great tasting food and cocktails made with fresh fruit juice at a really good price."

The location is perfect though. Closer to the castle, to the city and to the port.
The place is also a very open, free place. There are a lot of artists around and you can feel/see a Rasta vibe.
People are superfriendly. I needed a day but then I loved this place.
The chef is the soul of the house and the owner cares for his guests."
7091,"Wirklich nicht zu empfehlen. Wir hatten schon beim Einchecken ein sehr ungutes Gefühl und dies wurde bestätigt, als wir unser Zimmer sehen, sehr klein und ungepflegt. Wir waren in Ghana in mehreren Hotels, dies war mit Abstand das schlechteste. Glücklicherweise bekamen wir im benachbarten Hotel noch ein Zimmer und haben im Orange Beach lieber umsonst bezahlt als dort zu bleiben."
7092,nan
7093,"This is a place for those below 40yrs old due to the vibe around it.The structure and the entire set up is suitable for those below the mentioned age. The music in the club next to the resort can be too loud for those who wanna sleep early. But if you enjoy partying, clubbing n good company, you are in the ryt place.

The rooms are clean, beds comfortable, good unlimited wi-fi. The view of the beach when sitting on the deck is magnificent. This place is ryt on the beach and you get to play beach soccer, volleyball and have a nice walk. Another advantage is that, it is a 3 minute walk from the Cape Coast Castle. Infact, when sitting on the deck, u can see the castle.

Breakfast is good although it is the same everyday. There is a variety to choose from for lunch and dinner. Try Fish and Vegetable rice and you will thank me later. It was the best I have ever tasted. Remember to place your order early because the meal will be prepared from scratch specifically for you.

The staff is so kind, professional and always willing to assist. I will definitely come back and bring friends with me."
7094,Very beautiful and great service.
7095,"Came here for the second time and it was another great experience. The lodge has expanded their outside seating area with a rooftop deck that has amazing views on the beach. Evans is an outstanding host to his guests, very accommodating to all our needs and more. Besides the close proximity to the castle (less than 5 min walk) and the direct beach access, the food should be another reason to book here. The chef prepares the best seafood for a great price. The bonfire and music in the evening creates a magical vibe that you don't find everywhere. Highly recommended. We will be back, thanks again for the great care!"
7096,Awesome
7097,Evans and his staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodating.   They will get you anything you need at any time. They have artists bring in lovely art works to buy and they arrange transportation and tours.  The location is awesome and very relaxing.  The on-site chef serves fresh and delicious.  I would definitely stay here again.

Now.. We chose this place because of the highly rated reviews but they are not giving the full picture. The standard is poor for my taste when it comes to the rooms. There was a lingering smell in the bathroom as the toilet does not flush well. The towels had stains and there was no blanket only a thin sheet.

If you need somewhere to lay your head one night then it’s ok. The price is a bit much for what they have to offer.

Very nice ambiance in the restaurant area with access directly to the beach. Food was good too. I had lobster spaghetti and my husband the chicken and fried rice. We both liked it.

The 3rd star came from great customer service."
