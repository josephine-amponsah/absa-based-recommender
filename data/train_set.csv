1,"I enjoyed my stay here . For a serene environment , choose Jonat Hotel ."

4,I had a splendid stay at Jonat Hotel . It might be new but the service there was great and the food was delish
5,"Staff provide warm reception , neat rooms , and room service available ."
6,It ‚Äô s a nice place to stay at . Pretty clean and the prices of the rooms are great . They also serve everyone breakfast which is a plus .
7,The Drowaa Plus Hotel is a the go - to place for stop by for a night ' s sleep . Great designs in room with great ventilation ( AC & Fan ) rooms etc . I recommend this place to all organizing events and looking for a great place to lodge .
8,Very quite location in Cape Coast .
9,In town . . . around IBB
10,The rooms are beautiful . Elegant designs . But the washrooms are in poor condition . And poor customer service .
11,"had a few drinks at their pub . place holds sentimental value as well for me , as my old junior high is only half a kilometre away . friendly and accommodating staff"
12,Close to the beach
13,Not in good condition at the moment . It has been left without any form of maintenance .
14,Its a nice place to be

21,"Magnificent place , comfortable accommodation , taste and refined kitchen , careful welcome ."
22,"Fantas Folly is our favourite place to spend a relaxing time at . Philip and Fanta are wonderful hosts , and always spend time to make you feel welcome . The food is great and good value for money . The rooms are comfortable and well thought out . The location is a piece of Paradise on Earth . We have a lot of wonderful memories of our time spent at Fantas . Highly recommended ."
23,No wish remains unfulfilled ! ! ! A little paradise on earth ! ! ! !
24,"Very poor service I received from fantas folly . Food took more than 2 hours and waiters were not smart too . They could not even recommend to me which of their listed food on menu is the best , one of the waitress mentioned she cannot recommend because it is not allowed . Their appearance was off for me also . Imagine going on a long journey and been given a poor service it was just heart breaking ."
25,"This is the worse place , I have ever been too ! ! They are very rude , the service is very bad . The owner and his wife wanted to fight with costumers , never go there if you want to have a good time ."
26,"An idyllic place , European cuisine , unfortunately very difficult to achieve . Use an off - road car if possible !"
27,"Nice place , very quiet , peaceful and amazing views . The only minus was that the water from the shower and tap was not clean at all and it couldn ' t be used ( big minus )"
28,"This is the best get away from the hectic traffic busyness and dirty beaches in Accra . Though it is said that the road that leads to heaven is narrow , get ready for the narrow drive haha but it worths it at the end . Clean environment , good for groups , good for couples to spend quality time together . Good for family vacation , good for kids , good for long walks by the beach . I strongly recommend"
29,Very nice beach
30,Amazing stay with mouth watering food
31,Great food and the beach is so relaxing ‚Ä¶ . Awesome place for a getaway but the road is bumpy so be prepared when going but definitely a gem üòç üëå üèø
32,"The worst ever customer service I have ever experienced . I checked in , ordered two meals and my wife surprised me with a bottle of wine . I them requested for a glass , which was brought . the manager / owner came to request for 29ghs for bringing my wine in as a guest who is accommodated there . I objected and he poured my wine in the glass away and took his glass . And he told me to check out and leave if I want to and I did just that ."
33,"Best beach resort in takoradi , clean beaches , helpful personal ."
34,"A peaceful haven surrounded by an overloaded package of nature : trees , birds , sky : sun , moon and stars and of course the ocean . . . Amazing ! ! ! Thank you Fanta , Philippe , Janet , Chef , Deborah , Ebo and the whole team . You make Fantas Folly a living haven and I am coming back again ."

39,Really nice ! Proprio Franc - Comtois ; ) ! Heavenly beach .
40,An amazing place for weekend getaway .
41,"An fantastic place with an serene atmosphere located right on the Butre beach . It ‚Äô s the perfect place to calm down and just enjoy yourself . The resort is built with a great sense of design and atmosphere by a nice couple taking very good care of you . I really loved this place . 
 The only bad thing was the internet connection that was weak , but if your not depending on internet - this is a perfect place to be ."
42,"Nestled among tropical vegetation , with the sound of the Atlantic Ocean rolling into shore , you feel far away from the hustle and bustle yet it is less than an hour ‚Äô s drive from the city of Takoradi . 
 Caution : Road is too rough . Consider Pick - up vans . 
 
 Beautiful sea beach with photogenic views . Clean area with water . The beauty of this place is the small rocky mountain ‚õ∞ . . just walk 3 - 4 minutes and click pictures and videos there . Adding some of the pictures . water is green , grey and yellow lol . . mix colour . 
 
 Make sure you order your food in advance as they will take 2 hours if they are saying 5 minutes . I had omelette and bread and waited for 1 one hour ."
43,"An excellent hideaway vacation spot for the couple who wants to get away from the busy city atmosphere . A very serene area with a beautiful beach . The food is great but takes a long time to prepare . I recommend ordering early enough so as not to be disappointed . One needs to note , however , that the resort is very far away from the main road . The road is generally smooth though . We could not find the sign at the main junction and this we missed the turn and got lost . Be sure to ask for directions . You will spend about 20 - 30 mins drive from the main road on dirt road before you get the resort . After the main junction there are signs at each junction so you will find your way . I recommend this resort for couples who want a quiet , low key and affordable vacation . Just make sure you have a 4x4 üòÇ"

74,"Green Zion Garden is an actual paradise . The various little / large rooms are like natural hobbit houses . No Aircon but sure a fan is grand . There ' s a tree house , too . The garden is immaculate , green indeed . Beautiful flowers , plants and trees . There are birds , dragonflies , a friendly goat , a couple of friendly dogs . It ' s right by the beach where Ellis has a beautifully decorated wooden bar . He ' ll feed you delicious veggie food and serve you tasty drinks . He ' s got the best smile . üíóThere are seats & shaded beds by the ocean . The beach is so clean - no rubbish . The cleanest I ' ve seen in Ghana . I should have stayed for longer . I ' ll go back one day . . . The village of Butre itself is across a rickety Indiana Jones style bridge and is a bustling lively fishy place . The children all ran at me for fistbumps & hi fives . Goats & chickens & dogs everywhere . We got a motorbike to Asa Baako Festival in Busua but walked back , the full moon illuminating our way across the beach , then our headtorches helping for the path through the bush over the hilly headland , with birds frogs & insects providing the soundtrack . A very magical special place , which seems to be growing even better with each new build & idea . Loved it üòä"
75,"I crossed rendomly the Green garden eco lodge when I was trekking on the coast . I met Ellis there , what a positive and funny man . We ate together and had good fun . He show me the lodge , very clean and nice place . The garden is crazy . . very good moments and vibes here !"

77,"They have OM sign on the outside board . You will see cats around . 10 minutes drive from fantas folly . He knows how to cook indian food . The man will offer you everything you want . Posting his picture too in the review . Offering free private parking onsite , Green Zion Garden offers pet - friendly accommodations in Butre . The bed and breakfast has lawns and hammocks for guests located in the garden . Guests can enjoy a meal at the outside garden restaurant that serves local , Indian and International cuisine . The property has an onsite bar at the garden also a coffee shop . You will find a shared lounge at the property and Thai yoga massage treatments are available ."
78,Paradise is in Ghana
79,Wooow it was such a special place ! incredible ! ! !
80,"I almost don ' t want to recommend it because the green zion garden is such a Hidden gem . Moreover Ellis , the host , is honestly the best Guy i ' ve met in Ghana . If you want the best all round experience when you are in Ghana , visit Ellis ' place , he will welcome you in his Zion garden ."
81,"Affable owner , good food , great to relax ! All sited in a beautiful , skilfully elaborated garden . Will come again !"
82,"A place in an amazing garden , Ellis doing great job to care for his guests , good food and clean rooms ."
83,Amazing place in butre ! !
84,"Super lovely place . Set in the serene and beautiful ambiance of one of Ghana ' s beautiful coastlines , the Green Zion Garden was the perfect location for good relaxation , good and peaceful unwinding . My host , Ellis was super amazing . A super friendly , hardworking and open minded gentle rasta man . His vegetarian cooking was top notch . His knowledge and sharing of experience was great . He prepared a bonfire for me and he is a kind of a good drummer too [ but pretty please , don ' t let him sing : ) ] The various lodges , from the dormitories to the upper deck of the tree house , were neat , lovely and awash with beautiful colors and traditional fabric . Bonus : when you request for a coconut , you get a fresh one which is cut from the tree right in your face . I sure will be there again ."
85,We passed dinner 06 / 2018 - the atmosphere in the restaurant / lounge is indescribable ! After the fantastic food we grabbed Djembe and guitar and sang together with the host under the moonlight in the garden until late at night . Nice place ! An unforgettable evening .

109,"The experience in Alliance was super good üëå . . . beautiful environment , services , and most importantly , the staff . To mention but a few , Hnel ( the 5 - star manager with sense of humour and HUMILITY ) , Samuel ( ever smiling dude in service etc ) , Kafui ( Front Desk personnel with swag ) , Jacqueline ( the calm and wonderful person , ensuring everything is OK ) . 
 Thanks ‚ò∫ Ô∏è"
110,It is a very quiet hotel but the rooms need cleaning The furniture and bathroom are very outdated
111,"Absolutely exquisite , nestled in the beach road area of Takoradi , Alliance is a home away from home . For the business traveller as well as for those seeking pleasure ."
112,"Not as beautiful as the pictures and reviews I saw and it looked quite tight , not spacious enough . But it has its good sides , didn ‚Äô t stay long enough to find them though"
113,Worthy experience
114,Clean and serene location with friendly staff . The rooms are very small but well maintained
115,Don ' t know whether it was the season and thus staff were overwhelmed but services left soo much to be desired .
116,Their food was exquisite
117,Cozy place with great service and value for money
118,"This is one of the nice and big hotels in Takoradi . I was hoping to have a better experience than I did ; especially knowing they are now owned by Eagles . Their staff were generally nice , but their services were poor . The breakfast buffet was very limited . We had the same options of food for our 3 night stay for breakfast . I wouldn ' t add it to my favourite places in Takoradi . Hopefully , they improve soon"
119,Nice place
120,"If not the best , it ' s among the best hotels in not just in Takoradi but Ghana as a whole . üíØ ‚ù§ Ô∏è"
121,I have a sound mind for learning
122,We stayed at this hotel for a family vacation and had an amazing time . The staff were friendly and went above and beyond to make the stay enjoyable .
123,My staying at Alliance is peaceful and perfect . The access road to the hotel must be looked at .
124,"Bad experience . Had to change rooms . Stained mattress , broken window , broken toilet seat and so many issues"
125,"Unpaved roads leading to the hotel , roomservice taking almost 1 , 5hours to deliver a simple meal , diarrhea from the food ( or water ? ) , shower spraying more water to the ceiling than to the floor , other guests playing loud music at the pool , male guest staring inappropriately at me in the gym and reception taking no immediate action afterwards , i won ' t recommend this hotel to anyone , especially other female foreigners ."
126,It ' s an amazingly serene and luxurious place to spend a few nights and forget about the world .
127,Very nice lodge
128,Nice place
129,I stayed in the hotel for a work related retreat and liked the experience . The rooms were very clean and their facilities were standard . Their front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming but two of the staff did not depict this trait . Their conference rooms were ok even though I think the arrangements of the furniture was not fit for purpose given the nature of our engagement . I didn ' t get to use other facilities such as gyms and so I can ' t attest to its availability or state . Overall it ' s a lovely place especially for a weekend getaway . .
130,There is a lovely ambience and I really enjoyed the buffet dinner
131,Serene environment
132,The best comes from the West
133,"Hotel is normal , but I wrote to the pool , and I was kicked out ( I would like to write to the pool with a high ! ! ! Fix the bug , pancreas , and so all the norms P . S . I left a goose in the room , throw it on Tinkoff Bitoch"
134,"üòç üòç üòç üòç 
 
 I loved our stay at this hotel . The room is fabulous . Furniture is so adorable . 
 
 The bedstead had this classy display of transparent material with super comfortable mattress and bedding . 
 
 The view from our window was beautiful . Showing the pool and vast green fields around the hotel . 
 
 Washroom , housekeeping and breakfast were on point . Rooms Rates are a little on the high side . 
 
 In the evenings during holidays , the live band music is a must . Anytime I ‚Äô m back in Takoradi , I ‚Äô ll surely visit again ."
135,"Management should just look things through , things here are way expensive , how can just 4pcs of spring rolls be 100gh . n to ma opinion u guys are losing customers . . cos alot of pple complaining about prices here . thanks !"
136,"Great hotel in Takoradi , very nice view to ocean ."
137,"indeed , we ' ve plays and we ' ve plays . . . . Eiiii takodi ! We have something ‚ù§ Ô∏è üåç ry üôè Takoradi to the World üå¨"
138,"Walk inn shower . Moderate neat comfortable rooms . There are 3 swimming pools ( kids , normal & Olympic size ) . Well maintained . Dining either by the pool side , dinning areas or whatever is so comfortable and relaxing for lovers , family or business meetings indoors and outdoors . I can view what goes on at the beach , golf course , football pitch and swimming pools from the comfort of my room . This is üëå . Guess what ! The meals aren ' t expensive as I imagined . Wifi is unreliable ."
139,Calm space and very accessible from the Takoradi city . It ‚Äô s on the beach road
140,"Clean rooms , warm staff reception , with a good variety of options on their buffet breakfast menu . Lovely view of the ocean and lovely landscape from the hotel rooms"

148,Thank you to management and Staff . Excellent service .
149,Fantastic
150,"The hotel is nice however the price for this resort is not cheap and for a 4 star hotel I was expecting a higher standard . 
 We booked a seaview chalet but could not see the sea due to the back gate and trees . 
 The building needs to be renovated . 
 The shower was not draining properly , the swimming pool lounge chairs were not in good condition and the pool beds were dirty . 
 We didn ‚Äô t have have hot water for the first day and night , this was rectified but our first showers were cold . 
 We had a power cut which lasted more than an hour . The hotel should have an operational generator . 
 The only positive thing was the breakfast buffet with continental and freshly cooked food including local food that was very tasty ."
151,Air conditioning was poor and I hardly slept all night . Pillows were like big gummy bears ( extremely firm and round ) . Had some food outside at the back and it was ok .
152,"Very good hotel , clean rooms , very comfortable and delicious food , it ' s the best hotel to stay in Takoradi in my opinion ."
153,Great resort
154,It ‚Äô s absolutely beautiful ! Staff is very friendly and caring . An excellent selection of food on the menu . Perhaps a larger selection of onsite entertainment would make it the perfect getaway to stay in
155,"I absolutely loved my stay at Red Mango . I was there for my honeymoon and it was lovely . Their rooms were really neat and modern , staff were welcoming and friendly but professional , the pool , the food , the environment , access to town etc . It was a perfect hideout for us !"

 However there was a smell in the room which was quite strong . Smelt like sewage / something dump that didn ‚Äô t dry properly ; especially the area around the vent in the kitchen . Regardless , I was impressed , enjoyed my stay ."

254,"I think the management need to step up their game . . Room service was not good . . and I haven ' t yet know a guest house that charges Gh¬¢100 for a night without serving Breakfast , and even tying to get food around the area is quite a challenge ."

276,"Staf is Amazing , especially Fredrick who will help you out with everything . Loved the energy and the environment was very serene !"
277,"In the middle of an impressive green setting , the Ahanta Eco Lodge conceals a magnificent garden which will be the decor of your stay . Very diverse rooms , ranging from a suite with bathroom , some apparently without , to the Beach House , attached to the surf school of the lodge ( note that the latter are relatively distant from the rest of the lodge , it will be necessaryCount at least 5 minutes of walking , crossing the lagoon at low tide or passing through the village ) . In general , the road leading to Busua and therefore the eco lodge is rather chaotic and damaged . Count on a good driver and don ' t be afraid of the bridge over the lagoon . The team is responsive and accommodating ( we were able to change rooms at the last moment at our request , thank you Fredrick ! ) . The kitchen is cleanly fabulous , with various dishes and a different menu every day , with local products . The chef will be able to surprise you with his authentic and homemade cuisine . At the bar , Francis can prepare a whole range of cocktails tasty than each other . Special mention for your homemade akpetesthie and good humor : ) Our stay was more than pleasant , we hope to be able to come back soon !"
278,"I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot . The location is beautiful , I loved the tree shower . I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side . The staff was friendly , even though more information would have been helpful at the check - in . We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning . The food was amazing ( even though it was a bit pricier than at other places ) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful . The only thing that really disturbed me / us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom . We tried to pack drinks / snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff . I was personally very scared during night , because you could hear them and we saw them , too when we entered our room after a day at the beach . I called reception during the night , but they couldnt do anything about it at that point . The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof , but it didnt help . They asked for our understanding , because it was an ecolodge and animal - friendly place , but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument . Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room ( which is not animal - friendly ) ; ) Moreover , the next night when I used the washroom , a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning . I only then read that other people had rat problems , too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible . Still , its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua , but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience ."
279,"For me the best hotel in Busua . Super nice staff , flexible when it comes to the wishes of the guests , grandiose cocktails and excellent food . The bridge to the lodge is unfortunately an imposition and unfortunately I have to confirm the stories with the rats from other reviews . Therefore only 4 stars ."
280,"Nice accommodation at the end of the beach . There are rooms with different comfort . We were in the "" Wood House "" and that is rather comfortable . However , the photos are from the first bungalow in the garden in front of the restaurant . The food is excellent and the cocktails are also recommended . Because of the standing water in front of the garden , mosquito spray is strongly recommended . So you can sit outside ."
281,"Everything great . Essen , drinks & accommodation ."
282,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Ahanta . The rooms and communal area are very nicely done , very cosy and clean . 3 options are offered for dinner daily ( 40 - 70ish GHS ) which were always very tasty , and as there ' s one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests . There are also cocktails available , and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare . Busua doesn ' t offer a lot to do other than surfing ( offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta ) , so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading . We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren ' t many other options . There is also the Ahanta surf / beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out . To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon , which isn ' t all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels . You can also walk the long way around , across a patchy bridge and through the ( small and not touristy ) village . One or two other things that were less than ideal : - daily wake up calls round 6 . 15 from our local rooster ( in general we enjoyed observing the chickens / roosters , goats and dogs at the lodge though ) . Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night . - due to the rainy season , everything was very slightly damp ( bed sheets , towels , clothes ) and drying was difficult , some things started to smell a little moldy - the outside area could be improved with more places to sit , especially in the sun Other than that we had a lovely , albeit quiet time , the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return !"
283,"Great little eco lodge cornered off by a lagoon . Stayed in budget room which as the name suggests is pretty budget but still good value for money . Showering at the gigantic tree is definitely an experience . 
 Relaxing atmosphere and great food with WiFi . Prob one of if not the best place to stay in Busua hence it ‚Äô s popularity . Make sure you book in advance ."
284,"A wonderful place with very beautiful rooms , good cuisine and a great bar . ( Unfortunately , the associated surf school made an opposite impression : unpunctual , unmotivated guides and old , sometimes bad material . )"
285,"What a great experience and this is why . My friend and I arrived some days before checking into the space . The beautiful environment was just absolutely stunning . The tall old trees , the little garden and the use of every living thing there was breath taking . You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea . That was magical . 
 
 My first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself . It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop . The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly . You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first . And if you are allergic or don ‚Äô t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there . 
 The inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off . 
 
 We checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior . Warm showers , free Wi - Fi and a quite and siren environment . 
 The workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering . They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn ‚Äô t eat there the whole stay because it was delicious . My stay there was in great harmony and peaceful and I will definitely visit this place again if I have the chance . I highly recommend this place . Thank you Ahanta Eco Lodge for this experience ."
286,"An Eco hotel with luxurious rooms and facilities ; and an excellent restaurant with good vegetarian options . The road to get there was challenging , but worth the effort . The prices are a bit high , but worth it . Special place , even if you don ' t want to do surfing . Tends to be fully booked , so book ahead . - So yes rodents were seen once in the wall , as mentioned in other reviews . Not sure if it ' s against the spirit of eco habitat to exterminate them . however the nature of the clay / mud eco build means new ones can borrow back in from the surrounding forest ."
287,"I love everything about Busua Beach . . . I have never actually slept at ahanta but my friends have . Whenever I go to Busua , I have my breakfast at ahanta and sometimes dinner . . . It ' s"
288,Affordable
289,"Could be great or terrible depending on your luck ! 
 Let ‚Äô s start with the positives : the location is great , just by the beach , the surf school and staff is amazing , surfing conditions are great for beginners and intermediates . The food is tasty and the normal rooms are beautiful , clean and well - maintained . The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter - patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once , it can just be unpleasant if you ‚Äò re scared of such animals and hearing them close by . 
 In the middle of our stay , a large group of 10 - 12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music , laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests . Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero , it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again . 
 Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm , it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management . While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties , I also think it ‚Äô s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future . For what it ‚Äô s worth , after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge , but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions , staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations . 
 We decided to leave the lodge early , but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4 , 5 / 5 !"
290,"Very nice , clean and unique resort , great food & helpful staff . We had three wonderful days & then it really turned bad . A huge group showed up with loud music & party all night , loud music at the breakfast and no respect for the other guests . No reaction from the staff to interrupt it . No communication from the Hotel Management . Really disappointing ! For future stays the Management should give a heads up to the other guests that a party crowd is coming ."
291,"  ! ! Watch out if you want to bring your dog or you ‚Äô re fearing dogs ! ! The owners dog has bitten my dog several times and even attacked me when I defended my dog . He also bites humans if touching him . Even though we agreed several times that this violent dog is staying inside the office while we ‚Äô re around , he was still running around . They didn ‚Äô t stick to what they ‚Äô ve promised us , which was unfortunate because we wanted to leave after the first attack immediately . But due to their promises we stayed . If we would have known that they have a dog who ‚Äô s defending his territory by constantly attacking other dogs we wouldn ‚Äô t have chosen this accommodation at the first place BESIDES we were told that this is a dogs - friendly place . I was especially shocked of the reaction of the owner Julia , who was reacting very arrogant after my dog and I got attacked , when we had to pass through the hall . To my defend I didn ‚Äô t see the dog being there but when I saw him he was already on his way to attack us . 
 Except from the owner Julia , the team is very friendly , welcoming and makes you feel like home but I wouldn ‚Äô t recommend staying there"
292,The place is good for living and also having a nice road .
293,"We only ate here once but it was incredible . We stayed at the scorpion lodge but ate here , food was much better !"
294,We had a fantastic stay at the eco lodge . The rooms were very comfortable and stylishly designed . We had some delicious meals there as well . A great place to relax in between surfing sessions . Julia and her staff is also very friendly and helpful . We will be back soon
295,"My partner and I stayed for a week with Ahanta waves and really enjoyed our stay . 
 The employees are extremely welcoming and friendly . 
 Nevertheless I want to address some things that I wish I knew before my vacation there . 
 
 1 . The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor . For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall . Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available . So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days . 
 2 . The sea really smells . There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach . But if you walk further ( ca . 10 min ) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell . 
 3 . There were rats in our room . And this was something , when realised , we really struggled with . Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof . We have had our water and food poked holes into . But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me . The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls . If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room . 
 
 Ahanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind . It ‚Äô s made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious ( 4 - 7 euros p . meal ) . We liked our stay but If the communication and rat situation were tackled our stay would definitely have been more enjoyable . 
 Wishing all the best ."
296,Beautiful place üòç
297,"Good food , nice scenery , good customer service and great price . . . Honestly glad to have made this trip . And great place to surf for beginners too ."
298,"Very nice destination , probably the best around . . ."
299,So nice a place to be . . . . . Beautiful natural environment with nice people . The fufu is so good .
300,Ahanta is a beautiful destination in Ghana . It offers a local vibe with gracious hospitality . By far one of my favorite places . ‚ù§ Ô∏è üèÑ üèª ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è üåç
301,"The Ahaanta Eco Loge is a small resort that is concerned with sustainability . There is a solar system on the roof . The rooms are equipped with a climate . For me the highlight , the noises from the forest were . Grilling , birds etc . In the room there is a very good breakfast . The journey is an adventure . It goes over a bridge that is covered with steel plates . Unfortunately , the bay in front of the resort is covered and an outflow to the sea flies by . The sea and the waves are great . Attention current at low tide . You can shaft surfing there . The place opposite is a small typical Ghan place . We ate there near the school in a Fufu hut . A highlight for everyone ."
302,"We had the most wonderful almost 6 week stay at Ahanta Eco Lodge whilst volunteering at Asomdwee Fie Peace Home in Busua . Ahanta is low key , relaxed and green . Great kitchen and our hosts , Peter and Julia were very friendly , helpful and accommodating . All the staff are fantastic . Busua is quiet and on a great surfing beach . Surfing lesson can be arranged via Ahanta ."
303,It is a cool place to be if you need some me time . It has a very calm ambiance . Was a bit disappointed with the food .
304,"Absolutely delightful , lovingly kept place in a magical setting next to a fishing village . We loved the stylish , comfy rooms , the superb food and wickedly good cocktails ( the African caipirinha is not to be missed ! ) . There is also great surfing and lots of other activities . Combined with reasonable pricing , this is a five star place hands down ."
305,Nice place
306,"Beautiful location , great food . If you have dogs let them know ahead they have an unfriendly ( to other dogs ) but cute dog"
307,Beautiful warm decorated place and very good - healthy - food . Love the oatmeal breakfast ! Very good place for surfing even had my first ever lesson . Long walks to Butree and to Fort Dixcove .
308,Incredible place amongst the mangroves . The shower built INSIDE a tree - trunk was amazing .
309,"Everything about this stay was great ! I was in Ghana for a few weeks from the states and wanted to check out the local surf scene , so that is how I found myself at Ahanta Eco Lodge . The room was clean , air conditioned and settled between large trees down a stone pathway . The food at the restaurant / lounge area was delicious ! Chef did a great job . Bebe the surf instructor is a super cool guy that was eager to share his home waves and some technique to help me have an extra food time in the water . It takes some effort to get to this place , but once there , its a really great spot ! I would 100 % stay here again ."

452,This was a pleasant place to stay . The staff were pleasant . We wanted to go away for a few days then come back but despite repeated asking they would not confirm if there was a room - which was unhelpful . The food is vegan only which was not clear from the website .
453,"The rooms are basically clean and the building is painted in a beautiful white . There are seating and two hammocks as well as a bar or reception on the rather small outdoor area . You can also sit comfortably on the roof terrace , Only I don ' t like the lighting in our room : very weak and cold light ."
454,"Beautiful romantic place with incredibly dear people . Vegan food , clean rooms . Unfortunately we were only there for one night , but here I will definitely come back . You can walk to the beach in 5 minutes and it is very clean ."
455,"It is calm and relaxed here , cozy hammocks and a roof terrace invite you to linger . Nancy , the host , is a pearl . She even got us behind in the room because she believed that we had forgotten it . Breakfast is good , Nancy even buys almond milk in Takoradi . The rooms are calm and better than we would have expected at the price . On the beach you are on foot in 5 minutes . The surroundings are a bit dark in the evening , but in our knowledge is very safe ."
456,"Best place to stay in Busua ! Abu and Nancy are great hosts . Amazing people , delicious vegan food , relaxed atmosphere ."
457,How do you love artworks ? üòé order you the Christmas art piece @ benjee - artstudio
458,"Very nice hotel . Quiet garden , nice rooms and great food . I will come back for sure !"
459,Very nice Ressort with a friendly host that cooks very nice food ( vegan ) . The rooms are clean and the rooftop is just beautiful to hang out there even when it rains .
460,We stayed one week at this place . The staff is amazing ! Nancy is a phenomenal chef and served us delicious meals all day long . I ' m not vegetarian but did not miss anything . We could easily pre - order food over WhatsApp which was very nice . Abu is the guy who works the hole day and he can repair literally everyting . We wanted to make a long bicycle tour and Abu spent a full day just for us to make sure the bicycles are in perfect condition . It was a pure joy to stay there and I would recommend this 100 % .
461,"I stayed here with 3 friends and we loved it . Nancy and staff were very welcoming - they always put cushions out for us and even got us freshly picked coconuts . The food was very good and Nancy catered for a large group of us . Our room was bright , comfortable and clean with clean linen and towels provided . We loved the garden , the hammocks and the outdoor shower . It was a great place to relax . There is also a roof terrace where you can play games or relax . We extended our stay by one night and would have stayed longer if we could . We 100 % recommend !"
462,"This is the hidden gem of Busua , so much charm . . - nice vegan food from Nancy , - Uncle Abu who always does everything to make you happy , - a quiet place where the cool breeze makes a little better every day , - A place where we could also go very well with our 1 daughter , because the apartments are looking forward to the garden . That way we could have a drink or eat while she was in bed . All in all , go to Busua , don ' t doubt and go here . For me the most soothing place ."
463,Eating all veges dish was a great experience . Love to eat quality food Nancy has prepared at this serene environment .

480,Great staff and lovely setting so close to the beach . Really enjoyed my stay
481,"Clean , spacious room , friendly employees , really nice property . Wouldn ‚Äô t recommend the food , we paid 25 GHS each for very strange and unsatisfying veggie burgers that took over an hour to arrive . It was ludicrous , it felt like a practical joke . The burger was a tiny soggy mess on top of one slice of bread , and there were two pitiful slices of potato beside it . Very disappointing to two very hungry people . Other than the food all was well . If you stay here I would recommend seeking meals elsewhere ."
482,Relaxing hotel with friendly staff
483,"I enjoyed my stay here , rooms are quite iluminated and clean . Nancy was super helpful and made breakfast super fast every time - her banana pancakes are tasty ! They dont offer coffee option during bfast , so you need to go elsewhere if youre a morninh coffee drinker . As the guest of LG , you get to have a special offer for surfing classes , which is great . Also , they have a sister B & B by the beach called Coconut Dream that is a nice spot to hang out when you need a break from the sun . It was further away from the beach than I expected and you have to go through a small neighbourhood of houses with limited access to water , which felt invasive some times ."
484,"So this is about 1 year ago I was on a tour of Ghana and think back to my stay with missing and this particular place is an oasis of everything you want from a trip . The Laughing Goat is the best of the best . Super undercuting atmosphere , so nice attitude , good food , nice room and waoow , so beautiful . Nice , pleasant atmosphere and good hang at the bar . Missing ! ! !"
485,"Beautiful hotel close to the beach , very comfortable and clean rooms , and the staff are the best , very friendly and helpful in everything we needed ! We had 2 nights booked and finally stayed a whole week , also the food was incredible . We felt sick one day and they take care of us at any moment . Thanks for all !"
486,Is a place to be
487,"Excellent budget accommodation . Good service and ital food . You will have to walk by a mini village to get here , but it ' s brief and all else is eye candy ."
488,"Aboh , one of the workers there was very friendly and helpful in carrying our luggage and assisting us late in the night when we arrived . Room service was however very poor and the washroom wasn ' t very neat . The drainage system of the sink wasn ' t the best and there were lots of mosquitoes with no AC room ."
489,Nice facility with great roof terrace and garden . Vegan food highly recommended
490,The rooms are clean and big enough . In the night the bar in the third floor is open and the staff is very friendly up there . The staff is always open for questions . I recommend this hotel near the beach .
491,Closest to heaven that I ' ve been to . . .
492,Beautiful and cool

494,Ouahhhhhh . If paradise looks a little like that : sign up !
495,Amazing experience . If you want some peace and quiet this is the perfect place . You can do some activities in the towns nearby but its not really needed cos Lizzy and James will make sure you have an amazing time .
496,"Beautiful place , good food , nice hosts ."
497,Charming simply loved I ' ll be back at Christmas ! ! ! ! ! !
498,"My wife and I stayed there for one night as we passed along the beach and had a wonderful stay ! We actually only planned to spend the day there but enjoyed it so much we ended up spending the night and most of the next day there ! The setting is just indescribable . I ' ve travelled the whole of Ghana and it is by far the nicest beach in Ghana with a perfect swimming beach . Food is wonderful and the rooms and simple but have clean and comfortable . Have fan , running water , mosquito nets and nice bedding and sheets . Would highly recommend ! All previously mentioned security issues appear to have been resolved !"

505,"Superb site , good food"
506,The size of the rooms remind me of the cells in cape coast .
507,"The lodge offers variety accommodation , it costs 100 - 140ghs . It is clean and comfortable . Restaurant offers varieties of food , even vegetarian style . Just that food is more expensive than I expected . The bay itself is beautiful and beach is clean and safe , even for kids . You can visit nearby village . Just to get to Cape Three Points is bit of the problem as you either have to walk 2 hours ( which you have to hire guide ) or go back to Agona and get car to that place . The place is really calm and we enjoyed the beach ."
508,"clean beach , warm reception , very beautiful at night and early mornings"
509,Robberies take place over and over again . People from the village enter into the rooms while people are sleeping ! Check TripAdvisor reviews for more information . Don ' t go ! ! ! !

553,"Difficult to reach , but at the end of the street , a corner of paradise"
554,"I am simply posting here again because you can ' t respond to a post once the owner has posted . I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast . My father passed away some time back , I came with my friend , and we certainly did not receive a discount . The toilet seat was dirty , there ' s no way around that , I cleaned it . I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service . We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge . The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late , no arguing that , even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times . There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food . My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready . We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest , he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day . I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came , at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told . I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously . I caution those that want to book at Safari Beach Lodge . I truly wish the renovations are your only problems and once that is resolved the place can operate normally ."
555,"Great remote place . In the middle of the green , we liked it very much , the most beautiful and the Suabest beach in Ghana . Water and electricity did not always work , but hey you are in Ghana . Food was fantastic also gave something different every day ."
556,Cool place for relaxation

585,What a magical place ! The name paradiso is a correct name because it ' s a true paradise . The owner Gina is really nice and a great cook ! The rooms are great and you ' ve got a amazing view when you wake up . I would definitely recommend this place ! Gina heel erg bedankt voor de goede service en de gezellige movienight !
586,"My stay at Paradiso was everything I could have hoped for and SO much more . I left Busua with a community of friends who made my stay unlike any other trip I have been on . Gina , the host , is beyond accommodating and her staff is friendly , attentive , responsive , and a joy to be around . The property also surprised me . The location is perfect , a 3 - 4 minute walk from the beach and the chaos of the "" downtown "" Busua area , and feels extremely private . The view is stunning , right on the water overlooking Busua beach and Abokwa Island . The rooms were spacious and clean . I can ' t thank Gina enough for everything she did for us , and a huge thanks to her staff ( shout out to Anita for making such AMAZING meals ) . I will not think twice about staying here again when I return to Busua . Until next time !"
587,"Gina ‚Äô s place is the most beautiful and peaceful in Ghana . We enjoyed the food , the clean and amazing houses , the great hospitality and very friendly staff . Tonny and Anita are taking good care for their guests . The beach in Busua is absolutely clean , surfing is perfect ! Thanks a lot for all !"

589,"Beautifully located small resort with six round chalets ( 1 - 2 persons each ) with superb ocean views . An ideal place to just relax and enjoy the nice , quiet scenery at daytime with nothing but the breaking waves of the ocean and the crickets to hear at night . Nice , wide sandy beach is accessible within minutes by foot . The resort is in good condition ( rooms with restroom and shower , moscito screens , fan , fridge , safe ) , especially considering that the place is in the heart of real Africa . The owner and her personnel are warm and very friendly and will do everything to accommodate your needs and make your stay a pleasant one . Even if you come for only a short stay , by no means miss the excellent cuisine ; the owner and her assistant will prepare very tasty , freshly made breakfasts , lunch or dinner in local and / or international style . Full recommendation ! Eine wundersch√∂ne kleine Anlage mit sechs runden Zimmern im Bungalowstil ( f√ºr je 1 - 2 Personen ) mit herrlichem Ozeanblick . Ideal , um einfach mal auszuspannen und die sch√∂ne , ruhige Landschaft bei Tag und nichts als Meeresbrandung und Grillenzirpen bei Nacht zu genie√üen . Herrlicher , breiter Sandstrand zu Fu√ü in wenigen Minuten erreichbar . Die Anlage ist in gutem Zustand ( Zimmer mit Dusche und WC , M√ºckenschutz , Ventilator , K√ºhlschrank , Safe ) , insbesondere wenn man bedenkt , im Herzen des wahren Afrikas zu sein . Die Leitung und das Personal sind sehr freundlich , die Atmosph√§re famili√§r und alles wird getan , den W√ºnschen des Gastes entgegenzukommen und den Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten . Auch wenn man nur kurz bleiben sollte , darf man die sehr gute K√ºche nicht auslassen . Die Managerin und ihre Assistentin bereiten alle Mahlzeiten ( Fr√ºhst√ºck , Mittag - und Abendessen ) frisch und sehr schmackhaft zu , egal ob afrikanische oder europ√§ische Gerichte . Sehr empfehlenswert !"
590,"Wonderful gem , hidden away from the bustle , overlooking the ocean . A paradise for real , and Mama Gina makes sure it stays that way . She goes out of her way to make us feel at home . Every meal is home cooked and fresh . Sit under the canopies , gaze into the ocean and just relax : )"
591,Great place to relax with a fantastic view directly by the ocean . Clean and comfortable huts . Friendly and perfekt service . Best Food around . Real Coffee and fresh juices . A place to feel like home .
592,""" Good beach . Hotel outdated . "" One of the best beaches in Ghana , clean white sand and good natural views . The staff was nice and the food was decent , but the service was usually slow . If you ' re considering order lunch to be brought to you in the beach , do it 2 hours in advance . The rooms were confortable , but outdated . Forget the pool . . ."
593,"A quiet place by the beach with a million dollar sea view and clean huts , great food where you can unwind and hide away from the busy city life . Friendly staff , good hostess ! A place that stresses that the beautiful tjings in life shouldn ' t always be expensive"
594,The place is a total waste . The place is very dirty and mosquitoes infested . The authorities should simply close down the facility .
595,There rooms needs to be well furnished to be a normal standard room
596,It ' s good for a low budget guys . Their services are okay too . My first point of call anytime I ' m visiting Cape Coast .
597,It was very good
598,The room I went in was not good at all some of the plugs wet not working . . IN their rooms need renovation
599,"Jangels Hotel is a small place but it will work for you perfectly for that short stay , 
 From the point of students and academics purposes and low budget this is an ok place . 
 It ‚Äô s quite a low class place but due to its location near or on campus makes it easy for one to avoid moving long distances in order to save time and avoid stress if one needs to be close by for campus and surrounding activities . 
 I wonder why they are invisible when I was searching for ‚Äò hotels close by ‚Äô online , 
 Hope they do something about it to enable easy and quick online visibility ."

But the goalkeeper who did not know how to speak that English , has a chance to call on his neighbor of the hotel who speaks French well ( of Ivorian origin ) , to translate what we mean . The other inn costs 40GHS ( ‚Ç¨ 7 . 30 ) and that 80GHS ( ‚Ç¨ 14 . 70 ) . Photos seen from the collective terrace on the top floor without elevator ."

802,"Close to the Cape Coast Metro Mass Transport and is along the same road with Samoo Guest House , Oguaa Co - operative Teacher ' s Union and Church of Christ , Central Congregation"
803,"The room was clean and comfortable ( for the price ) . Furniture is dated and mostly damaged . 
 I travelled from USA with 2 teenage girls , Jan 2023 . We had a king size bed . The bed was big enough for us to sleep comfortably . Wifi is only available for 1 device per room . Imagine having 2 teenagers that have to share wifi connection . I ‚Äô ve never heard of this . To top it off the internet cuts out at 12am sharp . It ‚Äô s as though they turn the internet box off . Then they advertise free breakfast . This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd . The breakfast is the same for everyone . Absolutely no substitutions . The breakfast consisted of fried egg , baked bean , spring roll , bread and a bit of green salad . Portion is very small . The eggs were good . Had to throw out everything else . Very sad , bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn ‚Äô t be eaten . The pool is very unkept . Water is dirty . Thankfully this stay was only for one night . The staff made me want to pull my hair out ! They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them . They don ‚Äô t like to be asked questions . When you do ask they act as if they don ‚Äô t hear or understand my plain English . Then when they respond in a very soft / low voice and it ‚Äô s always sorry . They are not informative , rather very timid . But they communicate loud and clear amongst themselves . Overall I wish I could go back in time and get my night back ."

806,This the on going roof works
807,Perfect

The location of the hotel makes it attractive to travelers from both Accra and Takoradi to Cape Coast . Visit the facility on a sunny day to enjoy their swimming pool and good food . And enjoy your weekend nights at Samrit Club ( Presidential Palace ) and you will love Samrit ."

812,"The experience was not pleasant at all . Compared to modern city hostel in Bolga , their standard room is smaller , stuffy and their air condition was in a terrible state .

956,"Impeccable service . The staff are very attractive , kind and discreet . The location is very pleasant with a large garden , play areas and access to the lake . Nice environment , very peaceful . Perfect for observation of birds ( provide twins or long - lived ) Excellent , generous and varied cuisine . Everything is done at the time so you shouldn ' t be in a hurry . You can order in advance . The rooms are large and correct . Little water pressure for the shower . Possibility to park your car next to your room . Access is however complicated . The roads are difficult to pass . Make sure you have the suitable vehicle . It is a rather isolated place , like the other dwellings offered around the lake . You should know that it is a set of small villages living here . You will have to pay 10Ghs per person to access the valley ."
957,"PROS : I spent a night there . In fact , their service is top notch . The rooms are neat , my AC functioned well , the environment was neat except for the lake side which had recently been used by some other people before i got there . The food is superb . I had the opportunity to take variety of their meals ; Breakfast ( Milo , pancake , bread with fried eggs ) , Lunch ( Fufu and Aponkye Light soup ) , Supper ( Banku and Tilapia plus Special local potatoes with chicken ) , i ordered for special pop corn , khebab and fried plantains . Their food is by far the best ive tasted from any resort . The owner Maa Patricia is very friendly but i met these two people ( Solomon and Seiba ) , woooooooooow , their customer service and assistance is overwhelming . I will not hesitate to visit the place a second time . Cons : Despite the nice environment , there were few negatives . The road leading to the place was very bad and far . There were no walls around the resort ( security concerns ) , didn ' t really see any security guard around . They had some security cams but it was far from the car park . But in all I really enjoyed my stay ."
958,"The food , the environment , the staff more especially Madam Patricia , the CEO , very loving and humble . She has time for everyone"
959,"I enjoyed the ecofriendly system at wildwin , their food was the best - jollof rice and their banku and tilapia was muah . . the owner , madam Patricia is such a humble and friendly person . Planning for another visit"
960,"Asked for a Guiness , 15 cedi . Was warm . When I left they said it was actually 20 cedi . If you only sell 5 or 6 drinks how do you know the price ? ? ? ?"
961,"Great place , toilet and shower were bad and electricity fail many times . The restaurant was good and you should take the tour on the boat , it was fun ."
962,"It ‚Äô s a beautiful resort right on the Lake Bosumtwi . You ‚Äô ll love because the food is so good and the atmosphere is so relaxing . You can take a swim here . The staff are very nice and the owner very friendly . 
 
 Downside : warm shower is an issue if that ‚Äô s what you want . 
 
 Otherwise , I totally enjoyed the stay and had a blast ."
963,"Loved the environment . Very serene , great food , beautiful environment . Staff are friendly too . Ultimate escape to reset and meditate , reconnect with nature . Counting the days to my next visit ."
964,The view of the lake and its serenity is absolutely worth the journey there ‚ú® !
965,Bad policy . Not good at all . By force ordering of food .

967,one of the best resort you get for your leisure . Don ' t miss out .
968,They don ' t the best of roads though but a serene natural environment with the view of the lake
969,Was in for my birthday and I love the environment
970,The natural environment and the lake is healing and fun .
971,"Staffs are very friendly , patient and very respectful . Rooms and bathrooms are very neat , food is very delicious , the wildwin drinks they make is to die for , last but not the least is the place itself surrounded with different fruits , and is facing the lake . most nights I slept out side just listening to the sound of the lake and watching the stars and moon above . In short I will recommend this place to anyone who needs a getaway to rest and relax ."
972,Great weekend getaway . easy access to the lake and nature . Good customer service all around . Seiba and Godwin was very helpful and their free breakfast was on par .
973,Great experience
974,"Beautiful grounds . Willing staff who have no intuition and clearly have not been trained . They are willing bit trust me , everything takes long . We waited over half hour for breakfast and longer for dinner . The bedroom wasn ' t all that . We had a blue light in the bathroom . . . . strange . . . . . only one towel and they knew two people were staying in the room !"
975,"Beautiful serene place , good people , delicious meals ."
976,Nice place and enough space for family outing . A view of the Lake Bosomtwe . But the road to the location is not encouraging .
977,"My first experience here was in June 2021 . I fell in love with the place . The water , the trees , the birds of different colours ! Oh my ! I couldn ‚Äô t help but come here this weekend of my birthday Oct 2nd - 4th ! It was a magical experience as I swam in the lake Bosomtwe for the first time , I did my meditations by the lake at 5am with the birds singing the sun rising and the calm of the lake . The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn ‚Äô t changed . It feels like home . They even made me a surprise birthday local food ! I will never forget this weekend . The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything . When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave . They rained insults on the whole place . I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour . If you have food just eat at home . You can ‚Äô t bring food to a restaurant ! Why do we do this to good businesses ? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen . Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021 . Can ‚Äô t wait to see blue and green birds and swim in lake Bosomtwe . I could live there all my life : )"
978,Good chef . Quiet environment .
979,I really love the place . We had a refresher course there and it was indeed very refreshing . Very nice and serene environment

981,Nice place in a village setting .
982,It was a great time and the view with the lake is breath taking
983,I loved how neat and serene the place was . It ‚Äô s a good place to visit when you want to run away from all the chaos in the city . And the customer service was wonderful as well .
984,Good place to relax and unplug . Location is perfect but waiting service can be better . Will recommend this place if you ' re looking for cool place to get away .
985,Good customer care
986,"We really enjoyed Blue Diamond . Easy booking , great communication , easy to find and really not a bad drive from Accra . Ordering drinks and meals was an easy WhatsApp message . We ordered food one night , which was good and we brought bbq for the second night . I like that they allow you to bring your own food . The rooms are super basic but we spent all our time at the beach anyway . The beach is clean and safe to swim in . Decent waves for boogie boarding and even some surfing ( there was a decent break down the beach a bit ) . It feels good to find a place to escape Accra and really be required to do nothing but relax ."
987,"Nice clean beach getaway from Accra . Beautiful shoreline with some waves for body surfing ( closes out too quick for surfing ) . Resort food is yummy . You can bring your own charcoal and grill food your own as well . Dmall nighltly bonfire ( weekends only ? ) . Small but clean pool . Very nice spot for families . Drinks were on thr pricier side , but you can order them up via WhatsApp which is convenient . Rooms had AC and a mini fridge - honestly didn ' t spend much time in thr room awake . No stores nearby so bring your own snacks and maybe water . Rooms get sandy - a floor mat would be nice inside the door . Manager person ( owner ? German lady ) had great communication skills ) ."
988,"Blue Diamond Beach Resort lives upto its name . It has a clean beach and view is picture perfect . Service staff is very polite and professional in approach . Long walks ( 7 - 10 Km ) on beach is normal . villagers fishing nearby adds to experience of local people & culture . Ride the waves get your board . Swings , hammock under coconut trees give you true feel of beach resort . Rooms are functional but well maintained . Overall an excellent place . Place is cosy and gives you privacy . . . üçæü•ÇüçªüçπüèÑüå¥"
989,"A lovely hideout from the hustle and bustle of city life . An escape route really . Serene atmosphere with a well trimmed lawns . Not an easy location though but once you get there , you will love it . A neat and tidy beach with life guards available to help all the time . We really had fun but the host was amazing ."
990,"Just came back from a 2 day stay getaway at Blue Diamond . Firstly the communication was as 100 % . All questions prior to booking were answered well and on time on the WhatsApp . 
 
 The outside : Arriving at the resort was easy we informed them of our arrival and someone met us at the gate . As you drive in you can feel the peace and serenity of the resort . It ‚Äô s very clean and the beach is well kept with lovely palm trees and shaded seating tables by the beach side . 
 
 The Rooms : We booked a conjoining family room . I must say the rooms were a big disappointment . The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture . 
 
 Food : Ordering food is very easy . A quick whatsapp gets you a quick response . However the food is 5 / 10 and overpriced for the quality . Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip . Cocktails are very nice . The blue diamond is as a hit . So was the Last Prayer 
 
 Overall the tranquility of the place makes up for rooms and the food and that ‚Äô s why I ‚Äô m giving a 4 *"
991,"Stephanie was the absolute hostess , she was very efficient and all , via WhatsApp , she provided very clear communication to address every situation . The food was great , everything on the menu WAS available , loved the grilled lobster , prawns provencal , and the sea food linguine , and the beach front was amazing , we absolutely loved eating our meals right on the beach front and falling asleep to the sound of the sea , a beach resort worth visiting , the rooms are basic but the beach is so worth it . I would do it again ."
992,Beautiful place
993,I enjoy ‚ù§ Ô∏è
994,"Great place for a nice getaway from Accra , great service , nice food and very nice sceneries at the beach and a great hostess ! PS : ask for the bonfire"
995,"Neat beach , good food , great customer service"
996,"We spent all week on the Xmil coast . The splendid sea , the well served and equipped beach . The excellent catering , for fresh fish , the excellent pizza , the courtesy and the cleaning of the place ."
997,Very lovely place . Was here 2015 and today too was great . Will always recommend
998,"Any reason why you don ‚Äô t pick your calls , if strictly by reservations then you have to keep your phone close to you ."
999,"Worst place to visit ! ! Never seen such zero hospitality in my life ! ! You can ‚Äô t even enter the gate if you don ‚Äô t have a reservation ! What nonsense is that ? Why don ‚Äô t you allow walk in customers coming all the way from Accra just to have lunch ? What ‚Äô s so precious Inside , that walk in customers have to be turned away at the gate ? ? Ridiculous behaviour by the lady manager who spoke on phone ! ! Will never visit or recommend this place to any one again ! !"
1000,After three years . . . Setting and Service as excellent as always . Location access is a challenge though . A bumpy 5km mud road leads to the facility .
1001,Neat beach good for jogging and beach soccer and affordable .
1002,"Food was bad , no wifi , tv wasn ' t working"
1003,Very beautiful hotel and good service
1004,We drove 30 min on a horrible road to enjoy lunch . At arrival they ask us for 80 to even get in to the resort and access the bar . Don ‚Äô t go here ! ! !
1005,Stephanie is the best ! Another fabulous weekend ! With a mixture of our own food and drinks plus Blue Diamond grill . I love the way she keeps tabs on everything that ' s going on using WhatsApp . The bonfire on the beach was awesome and the early morning swim fantastic . Departure cocktail divine ! Cant wait to go back
1006,Great
1007,Hidden gemüíé Blue diamond resort has a amazing beach . Lots of palms . Clean rooms with showers . Nice patio to sit on for the nicest views . Birds and lots of nature . No loud music or rowdy crowds . . definitely a plus . Easy to find and hard to leave .
1008,"We were at Blue Diamond Beach and Spa Resort for a weekend , we found a very clean beach , good food and great service . Definitely we will go again ."
1009,"For me its my favorite hideaway beach ! , cleanest beach , food was good , the cluster of coconut trees üòç"
1010,"Mosquitos in the room Flies all over the place Insects in the bed ( yes , in the bed ) Owner super unfriendly and does not care about the guests . Didnt even try to assist . During the night there is no one to assist if something happens . I came withy wife and slept maybe 4 hours because of the mosquitos . Really not recommend . . photos are misleading , we really didnt expect that from a German hotel manager ."
1011,"I came with my husband for a relaxing night at the blue diamond and was attacked in my room by 100 mosquitos . My husband needed medical attention during the night and no one was there to assist , not even with a first aid kit . The owner didn ' t even ask about it in the morning . Rooms are equipped with a specific glass that attracts birds and Around 5 am small birds just knocked my window so hard we werent able to sleep . We slept 4 hours roughly on a vacation night . Many flies were around when we had breakfast . The place looks nice but not everything that shines is gold . Really bad experience overall mostly because of the lack of availability and caring from the owners . Highly NOT recommended ."
1012,"Nice location , quiet , good service , clean beach ."
1013,Great stay at a beautiful resort ! The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the host was very welcoming : ) 5 / 5 would recommend !
1014,There ' s good food and snacks available You can also swim well around the coastguard
1015,Cool place to go

1019,So quiet
1020,Calm and serene
1021,"Amazing beach and great personnel . If you are looking for a place to run away from everything for a while and enjoy the nature pur , this is it ."
1022,Nice spacious rooms . WiFi not accessible everywhere . No WiFi at the beach bar either . Mattresses hard and dated .
1023,"Nice and quiet . A hidden gem . Wonderful owner , excellent food and very reasonably priced food and drinks . Nice place to be ."
1024,"We went to Brenu Beach Lodge for dinner and drinks . The road to get there is in need of work . The Lobster Thermador that I had was OUTSTANDING ! Agnes , the owner , is quite friendly and interacts with her customers . I enjoy going somewhere that appreciates their customers . We will definitely be back and next time I would like to stay in one of the chalets ."
1025,I call this place hideout peacefull environment
1026,"was amazing ! the beach is absolutely beautiful üòç the waves crashing in , sitting in the sand . . what more could you want ! !"
1027,The lodge is basic but they do their very best to accommodate their guests and are extremely nice and helpful . The staff is warm and welcoming . The beach is amazing .
1028,"This is life a hidden gem . Located right on the beautiful beach this location is great for folks who want to be isolated , away from the hustle , and always steps away from the beach . There was fresh food available 3 meals a day and a stocked bar . If you are looking for a romantic get away or time to reflect this is the perfect place ."
1029,"So far it has been a great stay . Agnes and Abraham have been gracious hosts . The rooms are neat and clean , although the bed is very hard . The beach is clean and the hammocks are blissful . The road to the lodge is absolutely terrible , but I guess that keeps the lodge exclusive . Well done Brenu Beach Lodge"
1030,Its fun to be there
1031,Nice place . Beautiful beach
1032,Beautiful place
1033,Beautiful scenery .
1034,Hotel relaxing with a good breakfast
1035,"Great break from Cape Coast . Takes time getting to it but worth it . Of you are going to eat , ORDER BEFORE you go so it is ready . They literally cook it to order so the food is amazing but it took a long time to get the food ."
1036,"We are back again . And this place is a classic family atmosphere . The best food , kind staff and a wonderful neat beach . Come , taste and see !"

Agn√®s was a wonderful host and Abraham , Eco , Francis and Co . have been very nice too us ."
1049,"Located upon a hill over looking the harbour the Abuesi Beach Resort is a great choice to stay for a night or more . The owner Samuel is very welcoming and ensures that you have an excellent stay . He also went above and beyond , helping show us the Fort San Sebastian at Shama . The bar / restaurant has a really good selection of beers and other drinks available , and the food was excellent . Our room had AC , fridge , and a TV , with a sea view from the balcony . They are currently in the process of installing a swimming pool with adjoining bar ."

1058,The saround is old they needs renovation
1059,"Really special place for special people you need not to go far if you are looking for a paradise in Takoradise in Takoradi . Why Abuesi Beach resort is special place as Mr Samuel Sawyer the owner addressed us welcome to Abuesi Beach resort special place for special people . Place the view is fantastic people the service was perfect , the room , The room were clear and spacious comparing to others resorts whereby their prices are so expensive . I have shocked for the price of gh50 , 00 due to the Corona virus epidemic the beach was closed sure ! I have to come back if I travel around Takoradi again"
1060,"I loved how nice and quiet the resort and surrounding area was ! It ‚Äô s situated on top of a hill with a beautiful view of the beach , which is unfortunately closed off . The service and staff were lovely as well ! All in all I had a good time"
1061,The waiters is not friendly
1062,"BEAUTIFUL VIEW AND HIDDEN PARADISE Abuesi Beach Resort is set on a tall hill overlooking the ocean , so all the challetes have a great view of the beach . Nice escape spot . The staff are well trained with a relaxed sense of humour and always eager to help . The room is always spotless , laundry service , fast and efficient . We had an opportunity to visit S√©bastien fort nearby and it was amazing . For the food , eating with the cool sea breeze and sound of the ocean waves makes everything taste better . In all the environments is very clean , Abuesi Beach Resort is amazingly romantic , we loved our stay and definitely return back again ."

1071,Uncle Sammy and the workers were really nice . Food was great too
1072,Nice place to visit
1073,Lovely experience will definitely go there again
1074,"Place looks good with greenery and has the African village concept . The reason why I ‚Äô m giving it a 2 star is because I don ‚Äô t know if it ‚Äô s still in operation . Went there last month and the place looked almost deserted , had to leave to a new place . I also thought the resort was on the beach but it wasn ‚Äô t ."
1075,Very beautiful place . Also a golf resort . Well manicured grass on the perfect golfing landscape . Situated at a very lush and serene place . Facilities include chalets for accommodation .
1076,Not bad
1077,"Great place to be , quite with friendly hosts ! A blend of modern an ancient architecture . A golf course available for golfers . Serene and very cost effective ."

1079,Nice clean charlets . Very peaceful and quiet . Great service from the staff .
1080,Good breeze
1081,Shama beach resort is Located at shama in the Western region of Ghana . This resort has a very conducive environment for deep relaxation . Shama beach resort can be recommend to use for a vacation from tedious work activities . It ' s closeness to the beach makes mornings at the resort very cozy . The resort has a large reception with television and fridge . The resort also has a very big golf course which is still under expansion . It has six chalet rooms which has a traditional outside design but with ultra modern inside design . Shama beach is the best place to be for your holidays and they have the best reception ever .

1094,Is a very nice ü•∞cool n entertaining place
1095,Quiet place
1096,Amazing resort to lodge and conference .
1097,"Beautiful resort , views are amazing . So relaxing and loved our room . Bed was comfy and massive , and as a family of 5 , they were kind enough to bring us a matress as well . The outdoor jacuzzi was nice , and there was pool and play equipment for the kids , which we all loved . Staff were so friendly & welcoming , special mention to Jessica from the breakfast buffet she was so helpful and friendly , but all the staff were . The only reason this does not have 5 stars is the condition of the roads & no transport provided from the hotel . Roads are awful . The potholes are massive . Resort would benefit greatly , maybe having a contract with a taxi company or drivers to ferry customers to and fro from the hotel . If you do get a driver organised , please agree prices beforehand , as we had someone charge us 100GHS to take us 10 minutes down the road , which is a lot of money . Would definitely recommend the resort to anyone , and will definitely be back ."
1098,It ' s a beautiful setting and lovely reception
1099,Service very very bad
1100,I love everything about the place except the road leading to the place . Aside that is a 10 for me . The food was affordable and very nice üòä
1101,"Serene beautiful place , we ' ll manicured lawns using a lot local stuff and innovative"
1102,"I have been to this resort . . Very slow service in agreement that one is not in a hurry . . but hunger make you pass . . When paying the account , a tragedy . . . I made the payment with my credit card and after viewing that there was a charge from my app . And having shown it to the two at the cashier . . . they kept saying that nothing had come to them . . I had to make a new payment . . in the end I obviously found two payments . . now I ' m fighting to make me get the maltolto . Open eyes conclusion because they try to screw yourself in all ways . . Never again in such a place . ."
1103,"Fantastic place to be . The river view from the comfort of your bed is just therapeutic . Good restaurant , food and service . Downside : The road from the town to the hotel needs to be tarred asap . If it rains , and you are using the road , it could ruin your beautiful experience the hotel offers"
1104,Good place for relaxation and comfort .
1105,I just passed by though
1106,Perfect
1107,Great place for relaxation and fun . Beautiful along the volta River
1108,"First , they have good food . And most other things were ok . However , I give them 1 star because the most important thing to me was Internet access . It was the worse experience I ' ve had in a while . It ' s a commercial property for God ' s sake . What would it take to provide proper WiFi coverage for the rooms , conference rooms , and public areas like restaurant and pool areas ? Some of us are happy to pay for it . But it was hard to even receive a single WiFi bar at most of these areas . And WiFi was especially necessary as mobile phone signals are weak due to the location ' s distance from the main town . For this reason and their nonchalant attitude towards providing reliable Internet access ( paid or free ) to guests , I give them 1 star ."
1109,Great View but Very Bad Service . . . When you pay for Swimming the resort provides Towels . But you have to hassle staff to get your towel . . nobody cares as soon as they take their money . . Very Bad food service . . food took over 2hrs after ordering when we were promised 30mins . . . We had to leave . . Honest Advice : Great place but make sure you eat at home before going
1110,"Located out of town by the Volta Lake , Sogakope Beach Resort and Spa is a beautiful place . Their rooms are well kept and their swimming pool is clean . Their jet cruise is unmatchable . I love this place . My only problem is the road leading to place . I hope it is worked on ."
1111,This place is kinda one of the fresh places to visit in Sogakofe . They seem to be striving to make it top of town . The water sports is fantastic .
1112,The access road from the main Accra - Lome Road is not the best .
1113,Fantastic environment üëçü§†
1114,Excellent Holiday Location . Super friendly staff and great food . Caution : prepare to battle with mosquitoes when you are outside at night .
1115,"The location is just serene . It gives you a homely earthen vibe whiles soothing your luxurious taste . The rooms just needs a little attention to details , like the TV , the bathroom wash sink . Reports on faults are slowly adhered to . But I ' m guessing it ' s the # Ghana4You attitude aspect . The Food . THE FOOD is just amazing . They answer to all Taste buds . . . This is my 2nd trip here , I ' m definitely planning a 3rd ."
1116,Good hotel
1117,Excellent resting arena
1118,"My stay was ok but I wouldn ' t suggest this hotel to be a one - stop for all things . There are more resorts in the area that serve better food than here . My brother ' s rice was burned , they put too much oil in everything , and the wait doe the food is too long . The rooms had nice mattresses but just a sheet to cover you , and the shower is unpracticle and a pain to use . The pool was nice , although it is saltwater . The beach is in walking distance just past the beautiful stone wall ( the pictures aren ' t updated , the beach isn ' t right there anymore ) but you can not swim in there , the current is too strong ! The people were nice , and the owner even tried to speak in french to my grandma , who couldn ' t speak English well . I recommend this place for a night stop ( with an extra blanket on hand ) and to use the pool . The food isn ' t worth the wait"
1119,Nice and neat environment
1120,"I absolutely loved this place . 
 Beautiful views , serene environment and very friendly staff . The owner was soo kind too . 
 If you want some peace and quiet to rejuvenate then this is your place . 
 I ‚Äô ll definitely come back again . I had such a great experience ."

1125,Quiet and serene atmosphere
1126,The environment is generally good for couples üíë . I actually made a mistake by going there alone
1127,Don ' t have air conditioner
1128,Hey it ' s a lovely place to be . You will surely love the place
1129,Must see and visit !
1130,Most welcoming . Nature at its best
1131,The best place for your relaxation

1133,So Good .
1134,"Perfect hideout for vacation or a getaway Friendly staff Owner is really nice Location and great with good view Not a crowded place , quiet and decent Fair price for rooms"
1135,"i was there on the 19th of september 2020 , i didn ' t see anyone around , blocked roads leading to the place"
1136,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Elmina Bay Resort ! The room was extremely comfortable , the WiFi was relatively good , the breakfast and ( especially ) dinner were excellent , and the pool was also a highlight of my trip ! Everyone was also so kind and sweet . I look forward to coming again soon !"
1137,"Please , if you don ' t get booking in lemon beach resort , which new in elmina , with better service and food , I would suggest you to postpone the plan to another date This place is obsolete for young people Breakfast which is suppose to be free , and you may think it will be buffet , no it is not , they will actually serve one egg to one person in breakfast , yes after paying like a four star üåü hotel , this place staff behaves like the two star üåü which they actually are . Total Disappointment üò° No go area , for young and happening people"
1138,Kindly add your contact information
1139,"Beautiful scenery , lovely staff , delicious food"
1140,A great place to be . . . Awesome environment
1141,About 3 and a half hours out of Accra but worth it if you want some quiet . The staff were pleasant and helpful . The bed was very comfortable and accommodations generally good . I loved the pool ( which was very clean by the way ) . The highlight was the beach access . We also got fresh coconut water . I will go back again .
1142,What a great place to for a quite and relaxing time . Attentive and friendly staff and good food !
1143,Yeah the place is cool . . .
1144,Clean and friendly environment
1145,"We arrived dusty , tired , and world weary from Kumasi . From other experiences in our stay I was skeptical that the location would be good . I was wrong ‚Äî it was great ! 
 
 We were greeted by Mr . Kweku who runs the operation . He quickly checked us in , answered some questions about getting around , visiting the national forest , and returning to Accra , and then insisted that we relax . We were shown to our room by the excellent Mr . Henry and Ms . Vivian , both of whom kindly showed us around and ensured we were taken care of throughout our visit . 
 
 The room isn ‚Äô t a room at the ritz . Let me confirm what some other reviews ‚Äî it ‚Äô s hot and the AC can take a bit to cool the room down . But on the positive side , the water pressure is great ( and hot ) and the bed is comfortable enough . 
 
 The pool is lovely , if a bit warm , and provides and amazing view of the crashing ocean waves , sunrises , and sunsets . 
 
 The restaurant provides a mix of western and African food which we really enjoyed ! If you are visiting Africa and having trouble finding local dishes we ‚Äô d recommend checking this place out even if you ‚Äô re just visiting . 
 
 The lodge arranged drivers for us to the National Park and back to Accra at a reasonable price , and helped us get taxis into the city to visit the castles . 
 
 Overall an excellent stay !"
1146,Wonderful
1147,Good place
1148,Great ! And lovely
1149,Have you enjoyed a whole night warming yourself under the sea breeze ? How does the serene environment of an abode enhances your relaxation and productive nights away from all disturbances . You are not getting me anymore . I am talking about this cool African traditional Rainbow Resort . There are more to experience than I do if you take those imagery yourself . It ' s affordable and pays highest welcome to international people . In fact they have a beautiful international reception . I just love African Rainbow Resort .
1150,I absolutely love this place . Everyone is so friendly and accommodating .
1151,Great
1152,Secure place . . .
1153,"Though rooms are spacious , the water heater was not working and no cook for lunch and dinner . TV had only one channel showing , remaining channels were not showing . Room service was not the best ."
1154,Very good
1155,Stayed here in ' 08 . Clean and nice from memory . Banged this girl and she was so loud it woke up the entire place . They didn ' t seem to mind + had a good breakfast in the morning as well !
1156,"Nice clean afordable place . Owner is very crazy and friendly . If her daughter is around she run a roof top bar with great music . Anyway the staff in the kitchen is very very slow , better to go eat somewhere else ."
1157,"While the quality of the cuisine offered at this establishment is exemplary , it is regrettably hampered by the protracted delivery time . In practical terms , one would be wise to order lunch in the morning to ensure that it arrives in a timely fashion , as ordering in the afternoon may result in dinner being served instead . In addition to this , the establishment is found wanting in several other areas . The quality of the internet connectivity is substandard , the level of attention and care provided by the food service staff is inadequate , and despite featuring a menu , cocktails are not available for consumption . As a result , these aspects are not deserving of any rating and are left unmarked . However , the accommodations themselves are of a superior standard and deserve a rating of two stars for their quality ."
1158,"What a beautiful place . We really needed some days to recharge , this place was perfect . The staff is friendly and they try to fulfill every wish . They extra organised soya milk for us . The beach view is stunning , we enjoyed breakfast there and the beach towels are huge : ) . It ‚Äô s possible to swim in the sea . They are building a pool . The place and the rooms are clean . the food is freshly made so is normal that it takes a while , the waiters are informing and its also mentioned in the menu . The food is delicious especially the pizza & fish . We definitely are coming back ."
1159,"Beautiful place . If you are looking for rest and relaxation , this is the place for you . Beautiful well - kept beach , with a wonderful backdrop . You can swim well in the sea . Rooms clean and well - kept . Fine food , is freshly prepared and therefore takes a little longer . The waiters draw attention to this and take the order early enough . They are very guest - oriented and try to fulfill all wishes , prepared and organized meals that were not on the menu . They are working on a pool that looks like it should be ready in a few weeks ."
1160,Nice little quaint beach resort . It was quiet and the perfect getaway spot on the beach . I would have loved a tutorial on some of the things in the room but still had a pleasant stay . I would return .
1161,"Nice , well - kept complex on a great beach"
1162,Good time in the ocean there . Enjoyed the food and companions .
1163,"Very nice hotel and beautiful rooms with everything working perfectly . Excellent breakfast , friendly staff , and close to the beach . Only downside was the road to access the property . Get the road fixed asap . Would definitely stay here again ."
1164,"Location is too far from everything , and the roads are a shambles - don ' t visit in rain ! The food was good , but we had to wait nearly 2 hours for it to arrive - not acceptable for the prices they ' re charging . Ruined the experience : ("
1165,"I loved every bit of my stay . The only minus , as others have already said , is the waiting time for food . I will surely visit again very soon"
1166,"Very nice place , comfy beds , very clean and cosy rooms , everything works , quiet AC , fridge etc . Great stay , best resort compared to their neighbours ."
1167,Room are great and fancy . Everything works perfectly in the rooms . Family friendly with kids playground and activities . Down side is restaurant service and food . Service is super slow and food needs improvement . Breakfast buffet was emptied by 9am with half of the guests were left in limbo . Tables couldn ‚Äô t be cleared to next guest with no where to sit . Had breakfast next to dirty dishes . We had a 2hr drumming and dancing session around 8 - 10 pm which wasn ‚Äô t ideal if you ‚Äô re a light sleeper and also considering it ‚Äô s meant to the a tranquil escape . There ‚Äô s more room for improvement .
1168,"Very nice resort , chalets are well spaced , rooms are nice and cozy , bed was very comfortable . Staff are very helpful and friendly . The scenery is beautiful . Only downside , if you don ' t have your own mode of transport , it can be very expensive if you want to go into town ."
1169,"Quite a drive from the main Accra ~ Takoradi highway , the road is a little bad in bits but the view and serenity of Charlestina makes it worth it . Very clean beach and calm , warm water . Very friendly and attentive staff and good accommodation amenities . Price perfect location for a get away from the chaos of Accra !"
1170,Excellent food . Great place for Children
1171,Wow . . . . it is such an awesome heaven on earth . . . This is what we call Paradise . . . It is such an amazing experience . Charlestina . . . The Best
1172,"Very nice facility . The street there is an imposition . Waited for food for a very long time . But generally very beautiful . Palms , right on the sandy bike offer beautiful photo opportunities . The staff is very courteous and tries to fulfill all wishes . The price for you is also properly in Ghana ."
1173,5 stars for Rooms n atmosphere . 5 star for view . 5 star for services . 0 star for restaurant .
1174,"Serene Seaview facility . Neat rooms , humble staff and friendly owners . I love my stay here . Will come again"
1175,Cozy place for a vacation .
1176,The resort is absolutely lovely by all standards .
1177,Rooms where neat and beautiful . Surrounding where kept at all time . Very friendly staffs
1178,Beautiful hotel for anyone who wants to isolate himself from the hubbub
1179,"A nice place to visit , nice wooded compound . Lovely gentle beach and garden sit outs . Nice rooms and a large very breezy restaurant . Needs to build their swimming pool very quickly to complete the range of facilities and make it more attractive ."
1180,Love it
1181,Tasty food
1182,In fact the place is very calm to refresh your mind and body
1183,"It ' s a really nice place , serene environment for social and corporate events . They have awesome customer service . Very good panoramic ocen view"
1184,Went for the food and I wasn ‚Äô t disappointed .
1185,"A really lovely place , the food was really nice . Especially Red . Plantain and beans was good . The chicken stew was good . The portion were for me a little too big but the food was great so it ' s not really an issue . However service was a bit slow but fortunately they did say in advance that certain foods would be delayed"
1186,Very nice hotel
1187,I came to the place no visitors was there also we request the security at the gate to allow 1 person to go and see facility bcoz i didn ' t saw any car or visitor at there place but security said we must pay and go onside to just watch and if you don ' t like don ' t come next time . So management look into the matter no one will come if you don ' t have good Welcome and Friendly nature
1188,Poor Management Attention
1189,For sure one of the nicest resorts in Ghana . The staff is excellent and the venue is great .
1190,Temporary closure
1191,Hotel is closed !
1192,Good food üëåüèæ
1193,Good place for relaxation
1194,"The place is nice but the roads are not good and at the some time there is a big refuse dump behind the Resort which is not good at all , especially when it is getting burnt ."
1195,üëç ‚úå
1196,"It ‚Äô s serene and cozy , nice beach and surrounded by nice community"
1197,Good
1198,"Unfortunately , the resort no longer keeps what it promises . The villas are very nice and really lovingly equipped . Unfortunately , the beaches are not kept very clean . Half of the wine list is not available . The first bottle of champagne was corked , well happens from time to time . The understanding for this was initially not there . In view of almost 1000 euros per night , rather less acceptable ."
1199,It is closed ! !
1200,üëå
1201,Relaxing . . . . .
1202,"Day trip with the family . Food was great , customer service was great . Maxwell and Emmanuel were very helpful . Seafood platter is a must try , enough for 4 people ."
1203,"Coo , nice experience"
1204,Cool
1205,Nice place
1206,Good
1207,"Please use the main road when coming and avoid all short cuts - the roads there are terrible . There ‚Äô s an entrance fee even though the beach and pool is closed for public use . The place needs a lot of renovation and maintenance is poor . The photos displayed on the site are old as compared to the deterioration of the buildings and environment . Prices of everything from drinks to food to rooms are exorbitant , especially food and rooms . Nice sea view by the way . Kindly call for enough enquires and prepare well ."
1208,Serene atmosphere and the less noisest beach ever visited
1209,"The resort may be beautiful , but we booked for 15 people , drove 2 . 5 hours away and they tried to charge 30ghc only to tell us that the pool and beach were closed . Smh ."
1210,beautiful place
1211,See you soon
1212,Very cool with calm sea view in a peaceful community
1213,"Google maps will take you through a very long and very bad route . Better off sticking to the main road . 
 Very warm welcome on arrival . Staff polite . 
 Butler available at the villa which made life much easier . 
 We were shown round the beautiful resort and the beaches are ooooooooh . 
 Great scenery for picture taking . Look out for they ones waterfalls . Totally enjoyed my stay with friends . While touring the property it began to rain and out of no where staff appeared with umbrellas ! Customer service is excellent generally . 
 However the staff embarrassed us when we were checking out . . A towel couldn ‚Äô t be found so they demanded payment for it . This was settled when the towel was found at the villa and apology remdered . A very unnecessary and avoidable incident . And for the price paid to lodge , a missing hand towel shouldn ‚Äô t be the reason to chase guests down . 
 That ‚Äô s why I give 4 star . Otherwise it ‚Äô s is heavenly . 
 Very expensive property . Go prepared üòÄ"
1214,Best beach in the whole GHANA
1215,"Great food , great location , amazing sea view with refreshing sea breezing and lots of area for running and playing around with children , pool for interested parties . Have amazing buffet services . Satisfaction is guaranteed üíØ"
1216,A Nice place to cool down when on that stretch of road
1217,Best
1218,Absolutely terrible
1219,Great View
1220,The workers are very receptive . Very serene environment .
1221,Fun
1222,"Great and their food is super , will definitely come back"
1223,Their rooms are cozy you will love it
1224,"I was there for about an hour ' s visit in 2011 . The reception , the kitchen and the swimming pool still looks the same and up to the international standard . I have not used the rooms before the current visit . Even though it was ok , it was evident the sea breezes has taken a damaging effect on the building walls . There ' s the sea defence that protects the facility from the terrible waves of the sea"
1225,"Customer service is good and the food woow , most of all my friend I got when I visited the Beach mr Ato more wins"
1226,"Reception was great , food was good customer service apt"
1227,Excellent service and facilities . A place to be
1228,Needs some renovations and facelift . It could be a real paradise . . .
1229,It ' s a very large complex . A map should be provided as a guide for first time visitors
1230,Good üëç
1231,"A simple getaway haven ! 
 I love their comfortable beds ( it was my favorite thing ) 
 Waking up to the sounds of the sea and enjoying the breeze on the balcony was another highlight my stay . 
 The facility needs upgrading tho . 
 The architect isn ‚Äô t so impressive apart from the reception hall . 
 Most of the fridges , and settings in the lounge were outmoded . 
 The staff were friendly and had contact to drivers who helped us around town . 
 I couldn ‚Äô t use the gym and tennis courts but they well maintained . 
 A 7 / 10 experience"
1232,Lunch was very good . The seafood was very good . The jambalaya could have used sausage other than Vienna sausages . The shito was outstanding .
1233,Very nice hotel .
1234,A bit run down but good value for money
1235,üëåüëåüíû
1236,Elimina Beach Resort is old but functional My family like the breakfast variety / buffet we always look forward to it .
1237,"Location is perfect , with sea view balcony . Good road access from capital to location"
1238,Serene environment . Workers are very nice and treats everyone the same . Rooms are cleaned after breakfast
1239,Needs a lot of renovation They can do better
1240,I enjoyed my stay
1241,Beautiful sea view for the honeymoon chalets . Good food and great customer service ü•∞ great place to meditate and bond with nature . Highly recommended for a weekend getaway .
1242,"Axim Beach Resort is such a magical place ! ‚ú® Ô∏è I will try to explain for you to get a better understanding of how beautiful this resort is . This resort , I believe , does not make enough "" noise "" bcos mehnnn ! They should ! The resort I tucked away on the beautiful hills of Axim . It is a little out of town and even though I travelled with Larry who drove and I played the role of the Princess we were both mesmerised by the sight of this amazing place right on entering the premises . All the rooms are chalets with beautiful sea views that you only need to see for yourselves to understand the extent of the beauty I am trying to explain here ! There is a beautiful pool downhill that one can easily sight from the top due to its extremely blue colour . The pool was very clean and very well maintained . The lawns beautifully manicured and the natural materials incorporated into the building of the chalets together with the view give the whole place a very authentic feel and make one intuned with nature . The beach has lots of coconut trees and so there ' s enough shade to relax and enjoy the Sea breeze . Part of the beach is covered with carpet grass , which was grown by the resort . We were there for just a day , but the grill at the beach suggests fun nights at this resort . We ordered some drinks on ice and food üòã . Of course , they didn ' t disappoint . The meal was super tasty . We were sad when it was finally time for us to leave . We have not stopped talking about Axim Beach Resort and Spa since we got back and , of course , am planning a long stay there very , very , very soon . The best resort in Western Ghana if you ask me and their prices are also very reasonable ."
1243,Excellent holiday and conference location .
1244,Axim Beach is such a beautiful place . The beach was clean and the place looked serene and peaceful . I recommend to persons who want a quiet environment to relax and have fun .
1245,Cool and Serene environment
1246,It ‚Äô s take to long order food
1247,Cool
1248,Very nice

1250,cool ambiance
1251,Very Nice .
1252,"Eric , the manager was very helpful . The staff was amazing . Beautiful and relaxing environment . Ist day lobster was good . Subsequent ones were ok . Will surely come back"
1253,"The view is to die for . One of God ‚Äô s gift to mankind right here in the Western Region . 
 You ‚Äô ll need to experience this place . 
 It ‚Äô s worth the trip regardless of your location to this location . And I maintain that distance shouldn ‚Äô t be a barrier . 
 Food is a bit on the high side but definitely won ‚Äô t cost an arm and a leg ."
1254,I loved there serenity
1255,"Great environment , üëç staff . . ."
1256,"Very warm reception from Philip at the front desk and the Manager is also easy to speak to . I loved my stay here , the staff were sociable ."
1257,Nice environment A peaceful environ for wellness and reflection
1258,Very well located . Well maintained . Very nice to relax .
1259,The serene environment alone speaks for itself . Their food too was on point . I took in some cooked plantain with garden eggs stew . Kudos to the kitchen team over there .
1260,Wonderful environment
1261,"Axim beach has a really cool vibe . It ‚Äô s a good place for couples who just want to relax as well as families who want to have fun . Facilities include swimming pool , play ground , conference room , 2 restaurants , beach and a zip line . I enjoyed their mushroom sauce and beef but everything else was just okay . I would definitely visit again ."
1262,They didn ' t want us to even bring in the wine we brought from home üò™ üòî üòû üòï
1263,Lovely n nice to be there
1264,They didn ' t let us in Cuz the security was demanding some amount before he will lets us in .
1265,To be exited to feel nature üå§ then choose the right place for your happiness ü§∏ ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è and to be served well üçΩ .
1266,"Amazing rooms , excellent food , friendly and great staff and service . Great headline and swimming pool . Wonderful place to stay on vacation . Loved it ."
1267,I ' d recommend this place to any couple looking to take a vacation away from the noiseüòâ to rekindle their flame . . Their menu could do with a bit more variety but asides that I foresee myself visiting the place again and again soon .
1268,"No long talk , just visit and experience the beauty and serenity ."
1269,Nice location . Prices can absolutely match the service tho .
1270,"Rooms are expensive for such a place , and road leading to the hotel is very poor"
1271,Beautiful
1272,Great place and great food
1273,Definitely loved every bit of it . Very serene and beautiful beach . going back for sure
1274,"Good food , quick service . Overall , the stay was great ."
1275,"I visited Lou Moon in December 2022 and the reception was really good even though the welcome juice was too small üòÄ 
 
 They have a swimming pool , a beach , a mini football pitch , and archery , all of which I had a chance to enjoy during my visit . The entrance fee to use the facilities was GHC 200 , which I thought was reasonable was quiet on the high side for kids . 
 
 In addition to the facilities , the food at Lou Moon was also very good , it doesn ‚Äô t come cheap . I had a chance to try a few different dishes and they were all delicious . 
 
 The customer service at Lou Moon was excellent . The staff were all very friendly and helpful , and went out of their way to make my day visit enjoyable . They were always available to answer any questions I had . 
 
 My only issue with Lou Moon was the refuse dump at the entrance of the hotel . It was a bit of an eyesore and detracted from the overall beauty of the property . 
 
 Overall , my experience at Lou Moon was fantastic . I would definitely visit again and recommend it to others ."
1276,"I loved every moment about this resort ! ! 
 I would love to shout out Aurther Kay Kennedy for his marvelous services . He was my waiter for majority of my stay , i came with a large group of gals , and he made sure our food was perfect ! He went above and beyond to put a smile on our faces ! ! I also enjoyed my bout ride and my message from monica ( i had to see her 4times ) ! ! Can ‚Äô t wait to come back ! !"
1277,May just be the beast beach resort in the country . Food üëåüèøüëåüèø . Rooms üëåüèøüëåüèø . Service üëåüèøüëåüèø . Amenities üëåüèøüëåüèø . Consistency over the years üëåüèøüëåüèø . A little more pressure in the showers would be GREATLY appreciated . The swimming pool is a great addition too .
1278,I enjoyed every single day of my stay and the staff were so friendly and willing to help . The food was also so amazing ! Highly recommend
1279,"The place is a sham bad service , food is bad plus they would waste your time and a very bad road"
1280,"Food was great , staff very friendly , and the environment felt so calming not to mention the beautiful beaches we went by when we went hiking ."
1281,"This is a really special place . Beautiful grounds , impeccable friendly service . Lovely beach ."
1282,Nice place but far away
1283,Excellent service and just a beautiful location . The staff is super friendly and attentive and the island villas are just a dream . In my opinion by far the nicest resort in Ghana .
1284,"This is around July 2022 . . . The Concept is good . I thought I was in for a good disappointment on seeing the main entrance and the bad road to the resort . Reception was good even though I arrived a day before my booking dates ! I got the standard room for a night since my booked room was occupied . My biggest problem was the bed . They ' re not spring mattresses and so you end up making craters in them after some time . Craters are not comfortable . Unfortunately , it ' s the same bed at our island room . At the time , some construction was going on , which was for a pool . . . i was happy about the idea but not so much for the noise . Food is good . Doesn ' t look enough but it is . But with one of my seafood dinners , the lobster was not fresh . Regardless , I would go back one day . . . must be budgeted for though . üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
1285,Lovely place for a romantic getaway üòòüòòüòòI had an amazing
1286,Nice view . Cruise ride was fun .
1287,Nice place with a sustainability concept
1288,A very beautiful oasis Excellent staff and service To be luxury there is still something still
1289,We already saw different bad reviews about the money aspect . They are true . Professionality is missing in the reception . Be careful at the end of the vacation with the check out ! And do it the night before . . . We spent 2 hours . . Then . . . . The swimming pool you can ' t use it . They will have a long way ahead before having it ready . Cold showers . The waiters are really good .
1290,The autmostph is expended with exquisite views from your room to the dining area . Is children friendly with lots of activities to enjoy as families and friends . The only side issue is the road leading to Lou Moon . It ' s needs works to make the journey more easier .
1291,"Words cannot describe our Lou Moon Experience . Truly Eco Luxury . Great rooms ( island challets are the ish ) , the food is just delicious , the tours are enlightening and the scenery are to die for . . . Lou Moon is truly a must visit ."
1292,"Am never a fan of the ocean , but Lou Moon made me fall in love with the beach . I saw their staff in a boat , cleaning and picking up any plastic from the sea and the shores . Marvelous ! ! !"
1293,"The resort is absolutely beautiful ! It is secluded and a long drive to get to if you are traveling from Accra . Despite that , I will return . The rooms are comfortable , clean and chic . The staff and service is excellent ! ! They are responsive and thoughtful without being intrusive or overbearing . They reflect Ghanaian hospitality at its best . The food and drinks were very good . The soups are excellent and we had some great dinnertime meals . If you are looking for R & R this is the place . The service is really next level which truly elevated our experience . Wholeheartedly recommend !"
1294,"We booked a villa and standard room at Lou Moon in May . Very helpful and wonderful staff . Fred our butler was the BEST when we return I hope he is still there . He was very attentive and met all of our needs . The villa was stunning to say the least . I booked from US and they worked with me for booking which was great . Cannot wait to return . 
 Con : it is not fully inclusive . For the price this is a standard and the only reason why I did not give 5 stars . Drinks are not included and you pay for all meals that aren ‚Äô t provided in your package . Be careful and ask questions about your package to make sure you understand fully what you are paying for ."
1295,"As a hotel this is an absolutely stunning place in a dramatic and enchanting location . Very stylish rooms and villas in beautifully maintained grounds and complemented by friendly and helpful local staff . Ghanaian warmth and international luxury combined . Good watersport facilities too with a shelterd cove offering some protection from the ocean swell . But take your own sandwiches or demand a self - catering facility . During our recent visit there was no sign of anyone with any cooking skills at work in the kitchen . We witnessed wonderful seafood being brought to the place by local fishermen but the food that appeared in front of us seemed to have come from a different planet . Old reviews of the Lodge praise the cuisine , but it has changed hands fairly recently and things must have gone badly wrong in the kitchen . The dining room is in a great location as is the bar , where the cocktails are worthwhile thank goodness . Unlimited potential with wonderful staff and luxurious rooms . But the food could not be worse . Nil stars for dining . 2022 - Looking through recent reviews I notice that many praise the food in the standard default way that is commonplace on the web . But there are still a few warnings about the catering appearing . So I stand by my advice . Self - cater after enjoying a drink and cocktails at the wonderful bar with perhaps a bowl of chips . . . ."
1296,Lou moon has always been a to go place for me . I drove to Lou moon from Accra and I think it has been one of the promising tour have have ever embarked on Room - 5 Service - 5 Food - 5 Environment - Amazing
1297,Serendipity
1298,Six hour mission from Accra and we arrived at the Ank Beach resort . Stunning location . We stayed in a family bungalow near the sea . Very spacious . Very slow food service which is the Ghana way . Food delicious . I would have given the place higher ratings but for slow service at times . If you want to escape Accra and see more of Ghana this place is perfect .
1299,"Amazing place , quiet and relaxing with a lovely beach ."
