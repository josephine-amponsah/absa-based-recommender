Set in the serene and beautiful ambiance of one of Ghana ' s beautiful coastlines , the Green Zion Garden was the perfect location for good relaxation , good and peaceful unwinding . My host , Ellis was super amazing . A super friendly , hardworking and open minded gentle rasta man . His vegetarian cooking was top notch . His knowledge and sharing of experience was great . He prepared a bonfire for me and he is a kind of a good drummer too [ but pretty please , don ' t let him sing : ) ] The various lodges , from the dormitories to the upper deck of the tree house , were neat , lovely and awash with beautiful colors and traditional fabric .

My first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself . It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop . The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant $T$ . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly . You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first . And if you are allergic or don ‚Äô t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there .

Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm , it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from $T$ or management . While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties , I also think it ‚Äô s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future . For what it ‚Äô s worth , after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge , but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions , staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations .

1 . The $T$ towards us costumers was fairly poor . For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall .

3 . There were $T$ in our room . And this was something , when realised , we really struggled with . Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof . We have had our water and food poked holes into . But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me . The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls . If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room .

It goes over a bridge that is covered with steel plates . Unfortunately , the bay in front of the resort is covered and an outflow to the sea flies by . The sea and the waves are great .

The $T$ was clean , air conditioned and settled between large trees down a stone pathway . The food at the restaurant / lounge area was delicious ! Chef did a great job . Bebe the surf instructor is a super cool guy that was eager to share his home waves and some technique to help me have an extra food time in the water . It takes some effort to get to this place , but once there , its a really great spot ! I would 100 % stay here again . "

We could easily pre - order food over WhatsApp which was very nice . Abu is the guy who works the hole day and he can repair literally everyting . We wanted to make a long bicycle tour and Abu spent a full day just for us to make sure the bicycles are in perfect condition . It was a pure joy to stay there and I would recommend this 100 % .

507 , " The lodge offers variety accommodation , it $T$ 100 - 140ghs . It is clean and comfortable . Restaurant offers varieties of food , even vegetarian style . Just that food is more expensive than I expected . The bay itself is beautiful and beach is clean and safe , even for kids . You can visit nearby village . Just to get to Cape Three Points is bit of the problem as you either have to walk 2 hours ( which you have to hire guide ) or go back to Agona and get car to that place . The place is really calm and we enjoyed the beach . "

Gina , the host , is beyond accommodating and her staff is friendly , attentive , responsive , and a joy to be around . The property also surprised me . The location is perfect , a 3 - 4 minute walk from the beach and the chaos of the " " downtown " " Busua area , and feels extremely private . The view is stunning , right on the water overlooking Busua beach and Abokwa Island . The rooms were spacious and clean . I can ' t thank Gina enough for everything she did for us , and a huge thanks to her staff ( shout out to Anita for making such AMAZING meals ) . I will not think twice about staying here again when I return to Busua . Until next time ! "

You can order in advance . The rooms are large and correct . Little water pressure for the shower . Possibility to park your car next to your room . Access is however complicated . The roads are difficult to pass . Make sure you have the suitable vehicle . It is a rather isolated place , like the other dwellings offered around the lake .

Nice environment , very peaceful . Perfect for observation of birds ( provide twins or long - lived ) Excellent , generous and varied cuisine . Everything is done at the time so you shouldn ' t be in a hurry . You can order in advance . The rooms are large and correct . Little water pressure for the shower . Possibility to park your car next to your room . Access is however complicated . The roads are difficult to pass . Make sure you have the suitable vehicle . It is a rather isolated place , like the other dwellings offered around the lake . You should know that it is a set of small villages living here .

The rooms are neat , my AC functioned well , the environment was neat except for the lake side which had recently been used by some other people before i got there . The food is superb . I had the opportunity to take variety of their meals ; Breakfast ( Milo , pancake , bread with fried eggs ) , Lunch ( Fufu and Aponkye Light soup ) , Supper ( Banku and Tilapia plus Special local potatoes with chicken ) , i ordered for special pop corn , khebab and fried plantains . Their food is by far the best ive tasted from any resort . The owner Maa Patricia is very friendly but i met these two people ( Solomon and Seiba ) , woooooooooow , their customer service and assistance is overwhelming . I will not hesitate to visit the place a second time . Cons : Despite the nice environment , there were few negatives . The road leading to the place was very bad and far . There were no walls around the resort ( security concerns ) , didn ' t really see any security guard around . They had some security cams but it was far from the car park . But in all I really enjoyed my stay . "

We ordered food one night , which was good and we brought bbq for the second night . I like that they allow you to bring your own food . The rooms are super basic but we spent all our time at the beach anyway . The beach is clean and safe to swim in . Decent waves for boogie boarding and even some surfing ( there was a decent break down the beach a bit ) . It feels good to find a place to escape Accra and really be required to do nothing but relax . "

The $T$ : We booked a conjoining family room . I must say the rooms were a big disappointment . The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture .

Food : Ordering food is very easy . A quick $T$ gets you a quick response . However the food is 5 / 10 and overpriced for the quality . Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip . Cocktails are very nice . The blue diamond is as a hit . So was the Last Prayer

The food was great , everything on the menu WAS available , loved the grilled lobster , prawns provencal , and the sea food linguine , and the beach front was amazing , we absolutely loved eating our meals right on the beach front and falling asleep to the sound of the sea , a beach resort worth visiting , the rooms are basic but the beach is so worth it .

They are currently in the process of installing a swimming pool with adjoining bar . "

Staff were so friendly & welcoming , special mention to Jessica from the breakfast buffet she was so helpful and friendly , but all the staff were . The only reason this does not have 5 stars is the condition of the roads & no transport provided from the hotel . Roads are awful . The potholes are massive . Resort would benefit greatly , maybe having a contract with a taxi company or drivers to ferry customers to and fro from the hotel . If you do get a driver organised , please agree prices beforehand , as we had someone charge us 100GHS to take us 10 minutes down the road , which is a lot of money .

What would it take to provide proper WiFi coverage for the rooms , conference rooms , and public areas like restaurant and pool areas ? Some of us are happy to pay for it . But it was hard to even receive a single WiFi bar at most of these areas . And WiFi was especially necessary as mobile phone signals are weak due to the location ' s distance from the main town . For this reason and their nonchalant attitude towards providing reliable Internet access ( paid or free ) to guests , I give them 1 star . "

My brother ' s rice was burned , they put too much oil in everything , and the wait doe the food is too long . The rooms had nice mattresses but just a sheet to cover you , and the shower is unpracticle and a pain to use . The pool was nice , although it is saltwater . The beach is in walking distance just past the beautiful stone wall ( the pictures aren ' t updated , the beach isn ' t right there anymore ) but you can not swim in there , the current is too strong ! The people were nice , and the owner even tried to speak in french to my grandma , who couldn ' t speak English well . I recommend this place for a night stop ( with an extra blanket on hand ) and to use the pool . The food isn ' t worth the wait "

Drinks are not included and you pay for all meals that aren ‚Äô t provided in your package . Be careful and ask questions about your package to make sure you understand fully what you are paying for . "

1298 , Six hour mission from Accra and we arrived at the Ank Beach resort . Stunning $T$ . We stayed in a family bungalow near the sea . Very spacious . Very slow food service which is the Ghana way . Food delicious . I would have given the place higher ratings but for slow service at times . If you want to escape Accra and see more of Ghana this place is perfect .
