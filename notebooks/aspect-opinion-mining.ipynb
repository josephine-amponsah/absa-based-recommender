Goats & chickens & dogs everywhere.\\nWe got a motorbike to Asa Baako Festival in Busua but walked back, the full moon illuminating our way across the beach, then our headtorches helping for the path through the bush over the hilly headland, with birds frogs & insects providing the soundtrack.\\nA very magical special place, which seems to be growing even better with each new build & idea.

De manière générale, la route menant à Busua et donc à l'éco lodge est plutôt chaotique et endommagée. Comptez sur un bon chauffeur et n'ayez pas peur du pont passant au dessus du lagon.\\nL'équipe est réactive et arrangeante (nous avons pu changer de chambre au dernier moment à notre requête, merci Fredrick!).\\nLa cuisine est proprement FABULEUSE, avec des plats variés et un menu chaque jour différent, avec des produits locaux. Le chef saura vous surprendre avec sa cuisine authentique et faite maison.\\nAu bar, Francis pourra vous préparer toute une gamme de cocktails plus savoureux les uns que les autres.

       " 'I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot. The location is beautiful, I loved the tree shower. I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side. The staff was friendly, even though more information would have been helpful at the check-in. We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning. The food was amazing (even though it was a bit pricier than at other places) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful.\\n\\nThe only thing that really disturbed me/us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom. We tried to pack drinks/snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff. I was personally very scared during night, because you could hear them and we saw them, too when we entered our room after a day at the beach. I called reception during the night, but they couldnt do anything about it at that point. The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof, but it didnt help. They asked for our understanding, because it was an ecolodge and animal-friendly place, but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument. Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room (which is not animal-friendly) ;) Moreover, the next night when I used the washroom, a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning. I only then read that other people had rat problems, too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible.\\n\\nStill, its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua, but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience.',\n",

There are also cocktails available, and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare.\\n\\nBusua doesn't offer a lot to do other than surfing (offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta), so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading. We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren't many other options. There is also the Ahanta surf/beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out. To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon, which isn't all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels. You can also walk the long way around, across a patchy bridge and through the (small and not touristy) village.\\n\\nOne or two other things that were less than ideal:\\n- daily wake up calls round 6.15 from our local rooster (in general we enjoyed observing the chickens/roosters, goats and dogs at the lodge though). Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night.\\n- due to the rainy season, everything was very slightly damp (bed sheets, towels, clothes) and drying was difficult, some things started to smell a little moldy\\n- the outside area could be improved with more places to sit, especially in the sun\\n\\nOther than that we had a lovely, albeit quiet time, the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return!\",\n",

You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea. That was magical.\\n\\nMy first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself. It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop. The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly. You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first. And if you are allergic or don’t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there.\\nThe inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off.\\n\\nWe checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior.  Warm showers , free Wi-Fi and a quite and siren environment.\\nThe workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering. They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn’t eat there the whole stay because it was delicious .

The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter-patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once, it can just be unpleasant if you‘re scared of such animals and hearing them close by.\\nIn the middle of our stay, a large group of 10-12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music, laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests. Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero, it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again.\\nGiven that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm, it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management. While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties, I also think it’s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future. For what it’s worth, after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge, but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions, staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations.\\nWe decided to leave the lodge early, but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4,5/5!',\n",
       " 'Very nice, clean and unique resort, great food & helpful staff. We had three wonderful days & then it really turned bad.\\n\\nA huge group showed up with loud music & party all night, loud music at the breakfast and no respect for the other guests. No reaction from the staff to interrupt it. No communication from the Hotel Management. Really disappointing!\\n\\nFor future stays the Management should give a heads up to the other guests that a party crowd is coming.',\n",
       " '!! Watch out if you want to bring your dog or you’re fearing dogs!! The owners dog has bitten my dog several times and even attacked me when I defended my dog. He also bites humans if touching him. Even though we agreed several times that this violent dog is staying inside the office while we’re around, he was still running around. They didn’t stick to what they’ve promised us, which was unfortunate because we wanted to leave after the first attack immediately. But due to their promises we stayed. If we would have known that they have a dog who’s defending his territory by constantly attacking other dogs we wouldn’t have chosen this accommodation at the first place BESIDES we were told that this is a dogs-friendly place. I was especially shocked of the reaction of the owner Julia, who was reacting very arrogant after my dog and I got attacked, when we had to pass through the hall. To my defend I didn’t see the dog being there but when I saw him he was already on his way to attack us.\\nExcept from the owner Julia, the team is very friendly, welcoming and makes you feel like home but I wouldn’t recommend staying there',\n",

       " 'My partner and I stayed for a week with Ahanta waves and really enjoyed our stay.\\nThe employees are extremely welcoming and friendly.\\nNevertheless I want to address some things that I wish I knew before my vacation there.\\n\\n1. The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor. For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall. Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available. So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days.\\n2. The sea really smells. There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach. But if you walk further (ca.10 min) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell.\\n3. There were rats in our room. And this was something, when realised, we really struggled with. Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof. We have had our water and food poked holes into. But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me. The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls. If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room.\\n\\nAhanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind. It’s made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious (4-7 euros p.meal). We liked our stay but If the communication and rat situation were tackled our stay would definitely have been more enjoyable.\\nWishing all the best.',\n",

Es geht über eine Brücke die mit Stahlplatten belegt ist. Leider ist die Bucht vor dem Resort versandet und ein Abfluss zum Meer fliest daran vorbei. Das Meer und die Wellen sind super.

I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast. My father passed away some time back, I came with my friend, and we certainly did not receive a discount. The toilet seat was dirty, there's no way around that, I cleaned it.  I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service. We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge. The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late, no arguing that, even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times. There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food. My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready. We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest, he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day. I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came, at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told. I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously. I caution those that want to book at Safari Beach Lodge. I truly wish the renovations are your only problems and once that is resolved the place can operate normally.\",\n",

The owner and her personnel are warm and very friendly and will do everything to accommodate your needs and make your stay a pleasant one. Even if you come for only a short stay, by no means miss the excellent cuisine; the owner and her assistant will prepare very tasty, freshly made breakfasts, lunch or dinner in local and/or international style. Full recommendation!\\n\\nEine wunderschöne kleine Anlage mit sechs runden Zimmern im Bungalowstil (für je 1-2 Personen) mit herrlichem Ozeanblick. Ideal, um einfach mal auszuspannen und die schöne, ruhige Landschaft bei Tag und nichts als Meeresbrandung und Grillenzirpen bei Nacht zu genießen.  Herrlicher, breiter Sandstrand zu Fuß in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Die Anlage ist in gutem Zustand (Zimmer mit Dusche und WC, Mückenschutz, Ventilator, Kühlschrank, Safe), insbesondere wenn man bedenkt, im Herzen des wahren Afrikas zu sein. Die Leitung und das Personal sind sehr freundlich, die Atmosphäre familiär und alles wird getan, den Wünschen des Gastes entgegenzukommen und den Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten.

The bed was big enough for us to sleep comfortably.  Wifi is only available for 1 device per room.  Imagine having 2 teenagers that have to share wifi connection.  I’ve never heard of this.  To top it off the internet cuts out at 12am sharp.  It’s as though they turn the internet box off.  Then they advertise free breakfast.  This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd. The breakfast is the same for everyone. Absolutely no substitutions. The breakfast consisted of fried egg, baked bean, spring roll, bread and a bit of green salad.  Portion is very small.  The eggs were good.  Had to throw out everything else.  Very sad, bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn’t be eaten.  The pool is very unkept.  Water is dirty. Thankfully this stay was only for one night.  The staff made me want to pull my hair out!  They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them.  They don’t like to be asked questions.  When you do ask they act as if they don’t hear or understand my plain English. Then when they respond in a very soft/low voice and it’s always sorry.  They are not informative, rather very timid.

I couldn’t help but come here this weekend of my birthday Oct 2nd-4th! It was a magical experience as I swam in the lake Bosomtwe for the first time, I did my meditations by the lake at 5am with the birds singing the sun rising and the calm of the lake. The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn’t changed. It feels like home. They even made me a surprise birthday local food! I will never forget this weekend. The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything. When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave. They rained insults on the whole place. I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour. If you have food just eat at home. You can’t bring food to a restaurant! Why do we do this to good businesses? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen. Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021. Can’t wait to see blue and green birds and swim in lake Bosomtwe. I could live there all my life :)',\n",

We ordered food one night, which was good and we brought bbq for the second night. I like that they allow you to bring your own food. The rooms are super basic but we spent all our time at the beach anyway. The beach is clean and safe to swim in. Decent waves for boogie boarding and even some surfing (there was a decent break down the beach a bit). It feels good to find a place to escape Accra and really be required to do nothing but relax.',\n",

You can bring your own charcoal and grill food your own as well. Dmall nighltly bonfire (weekends only?). Small but clean pool. Very nice spot for families. Drinks were on thr pricier side, but you can order them up via WhatsApp which is convenient. Rooms had AC and a mini fridge - honestly didn't spend much time in thr room awake. No stores nearby so bring your own snacks and maybe water. Rooms get sandy - a floor mat would be nice inside the door. Manager person (owner? German lady) had great communication skills).\",\n",

All questions prior to booking were answered well and on time on the WhatsApp.\\n\\nThe outside: Arriving at the resort was easy we informed them of our arrival and someone met us at the gate. As you drive in you can feel the peace and serenity of the resort. It’s very clean and the beach is well kept with lovely palm trees and shaded seating tables by the beach side.\\n\\nThe Rooms: We booked a conjoining family room. I must say the rooms were a big disappointment. The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture.\\n\\nFood: Ordering food is very easy. A quick whatsapp gets you a quick response. However the food is 5/10 and overpriced for the quality. Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip. Cocktails are very nice. The blue diamond is as a hit. So was the Last Prayer\\n\\nOverall the tranquility of the place makes up for rooms and the food and that’s why I’m giving a 4*',\n",

The road is generally smooth though. We could not find the sign at the main junction and this we missed the turn and got lost. Be sure to ask for directions. You will spend about 20-30 mins drive from the main road on dirt road before you get the resort.

       "  'I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot. The location is beautiful, I loved the tree shower. I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side. The staff was friendly, even though more information would have been helpful at the check-in. We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning. The food was amazing (even though it was a bit pricier than at other places) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful.\\n\\nThe only thing that really disturbed me/us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom. We tried to pack drinks/snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff. I was personally very scared during night, because you could hear them and we saw them, too when we entered our room after a day at the beach. I called reception during the night, but they couldnt do anything about it at that point. The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof, but it didnt help. They asked for our understanding, because it was an ecolodge and animal-friendly place, but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument. Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room (which is not animal-friendly) ;) Moreover, the next night when I used the washroom, a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning. I only then read that other people had rat problems, too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible.\\n\\nStill, its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua, but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience.',\n",

The rooms and communal area are very nicely done, very cosy and clean. 3 options are offered for dinner daily (40-70ish GHS) which were always very tasty, and as there's one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests. There are also cocktails available, and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare.\\n\\nBusua doesn't offer a lot to do other than surfing (offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta), so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading. We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren't many other options. There is also the Ahanta surf/beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out. To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon, which isn't all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels. You can also walk the long way around, across a patchy bridge and through the (small and not touristy) village.\\n\\nOne or two other things that were less than ideal:\\n- daily wake up calls round 6.15 from our local rooster (in general we enjoyed observing the chickens/roosters, goats and dogs at the lodge though). Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night.\\n- due to the rainy season, everything was very slightly damp (bed sheets, towels, clothes) and drying was difficult, some things started to smell a little moldy\\n- the outside area could be improved with more places to sit, especially in the sun\\n\\nOther than that we had a lovely, albeit quiet time, the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return!\",\n",

The tall old trees , the little garden and the use of every living thing there was breath taking . You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea. That was magical.\\n\\nMy first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself. It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop. The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly. You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first. And if you are allergic or don’t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there.\\nThe inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off.\\n\\nWe checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior.  Warm showers , free Wi-Fi and a quite and siren environment.\\nThe workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering. They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn’t eat there the whole stay because it was delicious . My stay there was in great harmony and peaceful and I will definitely visit this place again if I have the chance. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Ahanta Eco Lodge for this experience.',\n",

The food is tasty and the normal rooms are beautiful, clean and well-maintained. The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter-patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once, it can just be unpleasant if you‘re scared of such animals and hearing them close by.\\nIn the middle of our stay, a large group of 10-12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music, laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests. Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero, it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again.\\nGiven that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm, it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management. While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties, I also think it’s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future. For what it’s worth, after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge, but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions, staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations.\\nWe decided to leave the lodge early, but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4,5/5!',\n",

He also bites humans if touching him. Even though we agreed several times that this violent dog is staying inside the office while we’re around, he was still running around. They didn’t stick to what they’ve promised us, which was unfortunate because we wanted to leave after the first attack immediately. But due to their promises we stayed. If we would have known that they have a dog who’s defending his territory by constantly attacking other dogs we wouldn’t have chosen this accommodation at the first place BESIDES we were told that this is a dogs-friendly place. I was especially shocked of the reaction of the owner Julia, who was reacting very arrogant after my dog and I got attacked, when we had to pass through the hall.

The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor. For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall. Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available. So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days.\\n2. The sea really smells. There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach. But if you walk further (ca.10 min) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell.\\n3. There were rats in our room. And this was something, when realised, we really struggled with. Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof. We have had our water and food poked holes into. But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me. The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls. If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room.\\n\\nAhanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind. It’s made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious (4-7 euros p.meal). We liked our stay but If the communication and rat situation were tackled our stay would definitely have been more enjoyable.\\nWishing all the best.',\n",

I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast. My father passed away some time back, I came with my friend, and we certainly did not receive a discount. The toilet seat was dirty, there's no way around that, I cleaned it.  I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service. We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge. The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late, no arguing that, even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times. There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food. My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready. We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest, he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day. I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came, at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told. I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously.

This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd. The breakfast is the same for everyone. Absolutely no substitutions. The breakfast consisted of fried egg, baked bean, spring roll, bread and a bit of green salad.  Portion is very small.  The eggs were good.  Had to throw out everything else.  Very sad, bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn’t be eaten.  The pool is very unkept.  Water is dirty. Thankfully this stay was only for one night.  The staff made me want to pull my hair out!  They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them.  They don’t like to be asked questions.  When you do ask they act as if they don’t hear or understand my plain English. Then when they respond in a very soft/low voice and it’s always sorry.  They are not informative, rather very timid.

I couldn’t help but come here this weekend of my birthday Oct 2nd-4th! It was a magical experience as I swam in the lake Bosomtwe for the first time, I did my meditations by the lake at 5am with the birds singing the sun rising and the calm of the lake. The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn’t changed. It feels like home. They even made me a surprise birthday local food! I will never forget this weekend. The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything. When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave. They rained insults on the whole place. I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour. If you have food just eat at home. You can’t bring food to a restaurant! Why do we do this to good businesses? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen. Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021. Can’t wait to see blue and green birds and swim in lake Bosomtwe. I could live there all my life :)',\n",

Drinks were on thr pricier side, but you can order them up via WhatsApp which is convenient. Rooms had AC and a mini fridge - honestly didn't spend much time in thr room awake.

As you drive in you can feel the peace and serenity of the resort. It’s very clean and the beach is well kept with lovely palm trees and shaded seating tables by the beach side.\\n\\nThe Rooms: We booked a conjoining family room. I must say the rooms were a big disappointment. The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture.\\n\\nFood: Ordering food is very easy. A quick whatsapp gets you a quick response. However the food is 5/10 and overpriced for the quality. Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip. Cocktails are very nice. The blue diamond is as a hit.

The location is beautiful , I loved the tree shower . I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side . The staff was friendly , even though more information would have been helpful at the check - in . We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning . The food was amazing ( even though it was a bit pricier than at other places ) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful . The only thing that really disturbed me / us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom . We tried to pack drinks / snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff . I was personally very scared during night , because you could hear them and we saw them , too when we entered our room after a day at the beach . I called reception during the night , but they couldnt do anything about it at that point . The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof , but it didnt help . They asked for our understanding , because it was an ecolodge and animal - friendly place , but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument . Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room ( which is not animal - friendly ) ; ) Moreover , the next night when I used the washroom , a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning . I only then read that other people had rat problems , too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible . Still , its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua , but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience .\n",

The rooms and communal area are very nicely done , very cosy and clean . 3 options are offered for dinner daily ( 40 - 70ish GHS ) which were always very tasty , and as there ' s one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests . There are also cocktails available , and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare . Busua doesn ' t offer a lot to do other than surfing ( offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta ) , so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading . We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren ' t many other options . There is also the Ahanta surf / beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out . To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon , which isn ' t all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels . You can also walk the long way around , across a patchy bridge and through the ( small and not touristy ) village . One or two other things that were less than ideal : - daily wake up calls round 6 . 15 from our local rooster ( in general we enjoyed observing the chickens / roosters , goats and dogs at the lodge though ) . Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night . - due to the rainy season , everything was very slightly damp ( bed sheets , towels , clothes ) and drying was difficult , some things started to smell a little moldy - the outside area could be improved with more places to sit , especially in the sun Other than that we had a lovely , albeit quiet time , the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return !\n",

The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter - patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once , it can just be unpleasant if you ‘ re scared of such animals and hearing them close by . \n",
      " In the middle of our stay , a large group of 10 - 12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music , laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests .

      " Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm , it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management . While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties , I also think it ’ s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future . For what it ’ s worth , after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge , but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions , staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations . \n",

When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave . They rained insults on the whole place . I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour . If you have food just eat at home . You can ’ t bring food to a restaurant ! Why do we do this to good businesses ?

The only reason this does not have 5 stars is the condition of the roads & no transport provided from the hotel . Roads are awful . The potholes are massive . Resort would benefit greatly , maybe having a contract with a taxi company or drivers to ferry customers to and fro from the hotel . If you do get a driver organised , please agree prices beforehand , as we had someone charge us 100GHS to take us 10 minutes down the road , which is a lot of \u001b[31m<money:Negative Confidence:0.9754>\u001b[0m . Would definitely recommend the resort to anyone , and will definitely be back .\n",

This resort , I believe , does not make enough \" noise \" bcos mehnnn ! They should ! The resort I tucked away on the beautiful hills of Axim . It is a little out of town and even though I travelled with Larry who drove and I played the role of the Princess we were both mesmerised by the sight of this amazing place right on entering the premises . All the rooms are chalets with beautiful sea views that you only need to see for yourselves to understand the extent of the beauty I am trying to explain here ! There is a beautiful pool downhill that one can easily sight from the top due to its extremely blue colour . The pool was very clean and very well maintained . The lawns beautifully manicured and the natural materials incorporated into the building of the chalets together with the view give the whole place a very authentic feel and make one intuned with nature . The beach has lots of coconut trees and so there ' s enough shade to relax and enjoy the Sea breeze . Part of the beach is covered with carpet grass , which was grown by the resort . We were there for just a day , but the grill at the beach suggests fun nights at this resort . We ordered some drinks on ice and food 😋 . Of course , they didn ' t disappoint . The meal was super tasty . We were sad when it was finally time for us to leave . We have not stopped talking about Axim Beach Resort and Spa since we got back and , of course , am planning a long stay there very , very , very soon . The best resort in Western Ghana if you ask me and their prices are also very reasonable .\n",

Idk how but it goes into the drain and reappears under the sink into the bedroom . There were no floor mats nor towels like I earlier said . I think my room wasn ’ t made up after the previous occupant . So I go to the reception to make a complaint . I ’ m told they can ’ t change the room for me tonight because the manager isn ’ t available . Okay . No problem . So what do I do now ?

So we decided to eat , so we ordered and the waiter said it would take 25mins . But 25 mins afterwards food and drinks haven ' t arrived yet . After 5 mins we got our drinks then about another 10 to 15 mins we got only 2 of our meals . The pizza tastes good but there was an overuse of flour at the base and I had to scrap it off with a knife . Then 10 mins afterwards the rest of the food arrived . The burger wasn ' t just a beef burger it was corned beef and mince which wasn ' t right but the tilapia was fine . We finished eating around 4 and still our rooms weren ' t ready . Then we went to investigate why our rooms weren ' t ready , after we made a fuss about why our rooms were taking so long we then guided to our rooms . Also the bathroom had a werid smell which was like they used bad cleaning products 😐 The customer service wasn ' t great at all . So I came back again , on behalf of my grandfather wanting to treat us . And on the 26th Match 2023 there ' s a buffet . The jollof was good as well as the fried rice . Snapper was lovely . The fish and snail soup was alright however the fufu wasn ' t very nice . I would say the food is way better than last time but still there ' s a bit of improvement they can do . The dessert bar could have more options The fresh bread would be more pleasant if it was warm . It would be better to have more of a variety with the food and to be lenient with the spices as if people from aboard visit it would be hard for them to enjoy the meals .

He ' s been working there for years but obviously he is so daft not learn or at least to train himself for any further opportunities .

       " {'sentence': 'An excellent hideaway vacation spot for the couple who wants to get away from the busy city atmosphere . A very serene area with a beautiful beach . The food is great but takes a long time to prepare . I recommend ordering early enough so as not to be disappointed . One needs to note , however , that the resort is very far away from the main road . The road is generally smooth though . We could not find the sign at the main junction and this we missed the turn and got lost . Be sure to ask for directions . You will spend about 20 - 30 mins drive from the main road on dirt road before you get the resort . After the main junction there are signs at each junction so you will find your way . I recommend this resort for couples who want a quiet , low key and affordable vacation . Just make sure you have a 4x4 😂',\n",

It ' s right by the beach where Ellis has a beautifully decorated wooden bar . He ' ll feed you delicious veggie food and serve you tasty drinks . He ' s got the best smile . 💗There are seats & shaded beds by the ocean . The beach is so clean - no rubbish . The cleanest I ' ve seen in Ghana . I should have stayed for longer . I ' ll go back one day . . . The village of Butre itself is across a rickety Indiana Jones style bridge and is a bustling lively fishy place . The children all ran at me for fistbumps & hi fives . Goats & chickens & dogs everywhere . We got a motorbike to Asa Baako Festival in Busua but walked back , the full moon illuminating our way across the beach , then our headtorches helping for the path through the bush over the hilly headland , with birds frogs & insects providing the soundtrack . A very magical special place , which seems to be growing even better with each new build & idea . Loved it 😊\",\n",

Very diverse rooms , ranging from a suite with bathroom , some apparently without , to the Beach House , attached to the surf school of the lodge ( note that the latter are relatively distant from the rest of the lodge , it will be necessaryCount at least 5 minutes of walking , crossing the lagoon at low tide or passing through the village ) . In general , the road leading to Busua and therefore the eco lodge is rather chaotic and damaged . Count on a good driver and don ' t be afraid of the bridge over the lagoon . The team is responsive and accommodating ( we were able to change rooms at the last moment at our request , thank you Fredrick ! ) . The kitchen is cleanly fabulous , with various dishes and a different menu every day , with local products . The chef will be able to surprise you with his authentic and homemade cuisine . At the bar , Francis can prepare a whole range of cocktails tasty than each other . Special mention for your homemade akpetesthie and good humor : ) Our stay was more than pleasant , we hope to be able to come back soon !\",\n",

       " {'sentence': 'I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot . The location is beautiful , I loved the tree shower . I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side . The staff was friendly , even though more information would have been helpful at the check - in . We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning . The food was amazing ( even though it was a bit pricier than at other places ) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful . The only thing that really disturbed me / us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom . We tried to pack drinks / snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff . I was personally very scared during night , because you could hear them and we saw them , too when we entered our room after a day at the beach . I called reception during the night , but they couldnt do anything about it at that point . The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof , but it didnt help . They asked for our understanding , because it was an ecolodge and animal - friendly place , but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument . Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room ( which is not animal - friendly ) ; ) Moreover , the next night when I used the washroom , a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning . I only then read that other people had rat problems , too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible . Still , its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua , but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience .',\n",

The rooms and communal area are very nicely done , very cosy and clean . 3 options are offered for dinner daily ( 40 - 70ish GHS ) which were always very tasty , and as there ' s one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests . There are also cocktails available , and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare . Busua doesn ' t offer a lot to do other than surfing ( offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta ) , so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading . We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren ' t many other options . There is also the Ahanta surf / beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out . To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon , which isn ' t all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels . You can also walk the long way around , across a patchy bridge and through the ( small and not touristy ) village . One or two other things that were less than ideal : - daily wake up calls round 6 . 15 from our local rooster ( in general we enjoyed observing the chickens / roosters , goats and dogs at the lodge though ) . Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night . - due to the rainy season , everything was very slightly damp ( bed sheets , towels , clothes ) and drying was difficult , some things started to smell a little moldy - the outside area could be improved with more places to sit , especially in the sun Other than that we had a lovely , albeit quiet time , the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return !\",\n",

       " {'sentence': 'What a great experience and this is why . My friend and I arrived some days before checking into the space . The beautiful environment was just absolutely stunning . The tall old trees , the little garden and the use of every living thing there was breath taking . You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea . That was magical . \\n \\n My first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself . It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop . The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly . You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first . And if you are allergic or don ’ t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there . \\n The inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off . \\n \\n We checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior . Warm showers , free Wi - Fi and a quite and siren environment . \\n The workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering . They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn ’ t eat there the whole stay because it was delicious . My stay there was in great harmony and peaceful and I will definitely visit this place again if I have the chance . I highly recommend this place . Thank you Ahanta Eco Lodge for this experience .',\n",

The food is tasty and the normal rooms are beautiful , clean and well - maintained . The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter - patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once , it can just be unpleasant if you ‘ re scared of such animals and hearing them close by . \\n In the middle of our stay , a large group of 10 - 12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music , laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests . Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero , it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again . \\n Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm , it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management . While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties , I also think it ’ s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future . For what it ’ s worth , after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge , but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions , staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations . \\n We decided to leave the lodge early , but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4 , 5 / 5 !',\n",

A huge group showed up with loud music & party all night , loud music at the breakfast and no respect for the other guests . No reaction from the staff to interrupt it . No communication from the Hotel Management . Really disappointing ! For future stays the Management should give a heads up to the other guests that a party crowd is coming .',\n",

The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor . For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall . Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available . So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days . \\n 2 . The sea really smells . There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach . But if you walk further ( ca . 10 min ) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell . \\n 3 . There were rats in our room . And this was something , when realised , we really struggled with . Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof . We have had our water and food poked holes into . But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me . The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls . If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room . \\n \\n Ahanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind . It ’ s made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious ( 4 - 7 euros p . meal ) . We liked our stay but If the communication and rat situation were tackled our stay would definitely have been more enjoyable . \\n Wishing all the best .',\n",

The food was very good and Nancy catered for a large group of us . Our room was bright , comfortable and clean with clean linen and towels provided . We loved the garden , the hammocks and the outdoor shower . It was a great place to relax . There is also a roof terrace where you can play games or relax . We extended our stay by one night and would have stayed longer if we could . We 100 % recommend !',\n",

I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast . My father passed away some time back , I came with my friend , and we certainly did not receive a discount . The toilet seat was dirty , there ' s no way around that , I cleaned it . I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service . We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge . The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late , no arguing that , even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times . There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food . My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready . We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest , he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day . I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came , at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told . I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously . I caution those that want to book at Safari Beach Lodge . I truly wish the renovations are your only problems and once that is resolved the place can operate normally .\",\n",

The location is perfect , a 3 - 4 minute walk from the beach and the chaos of the \" downtown \" Busua area , and feels extremely private . The view is stunning , right on the water overlooking Busua beach and Abokwa Island . The rooms were spacious and clean .

       " {'sentence': 'Beautifully located small resort with six round chalets ( 1 - 2 persons each ) with superb ocean views . An ideal place to just relax and enjoy the nice , quiet scenery at daytime with nothing but the breaking waves of the ocean and the crickets to hear at night . Nice , wide sandy beach is accessible within minutes by foot . The resort is in good condition ( rooms with restroom and shower , moscito screens , fan , fridge , safe ) , especially considering that the place is in the heart of real Africa . The owner and her personnel are warm and very friendly and will do everything to accommodate your needs and make your stay a pleasant one . Even if you come for only a short stay , by no means miss the excellent cuisine ; the owner and her assistant will prepare very tasty , freshly made breakfasts , lunch or dinner in local and / or international style . Full recommendation ! Eine wunderschöne kleine Anlage mit sechs runden Zimmern im Bungalowstil ( für je 1 - 2 Personen ) mit herrlichem Ozeanblick . Ideal , um einfach mal auszuspannen und die schöne , ruhige Landschaft bei Tag und nichts als Meeresbrandung und Grillenzirpen bei Nacht zu genießen . Herrlicher , breiter Sandstrand zu Fuß in wenigen Minuten erreichbar . Die Anlage ist in gutem Zustand ( Zimmer mit Dusche und WC , Mückenschutz , Ventilator , Kühlschrank , Safe ) , insbesondere wenn man bedenkt , im Herzen des wahren Afrikas zu sein . Die Leitung und das Personal sind sehr freundlich , die Atmosphäre familiär und alles wird getan , den Wünschen des Gastes entgegenzukommen und den Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten . Auch wenn man nur kurz bleiben sollte , darf man die sehr gute Küche nicht auslassen . Die Managerin und ihre Assistentin bereiten alle Mahlzeiten ( Frühstück , Mittag - und Abendessen ) frisch und sehr schmackhaft zu , egal ob afrikanische oder europäische Gerichte . Sehr empfehlenswert !',\n",

We had a king size bed . The bed was big enough for us to sleep comfortably . Wifi is only available for 1 device per room . Imagine having 2 teenagers that have to share wifi connection . I ’ ve never heard of this . To top it off the internet cuts out at 12am sharp . It ’ s as though they turn the internet box off . Then they advertise free breakfast . This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd . The breakfast is the same for everyone . Absolutely no substitutions . The breakfast consisted of fried egg , baked bean , spring roll , bread and a bit of green salad . Portion is very small . The eggs were good . Had to throw out everything else . Very sad , bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn ’ t be eaten . The pool is very unkept . Water is dirty . Thankfully this stay was only for one night . The staff made me want to pull my hair out ! They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them . They don ’ t like to be asked questions . When you do ask they act as if they don ’ t hear or understand my plain English . Then when they respond in a very soft / low voice and it ’ s always sorry . They are not informative , rather very timid . But they communicate loud and clear amongst themselves . Overall I wish I could go back in time and get my night back .',\n",

       " {'sentence': \"PROS : I spent a night there . In fact , their service is top notch . The rooms are neat , my AC functioned well , the environment was neat except for the lake side which had recently been used by some other people before i got there . The food is superb . I had the opportunity to take variety of their meals ; Breakfast ( Milo , pancake , bread with fried eggs ) , Lunch ( Fufu and Aponkye Light soup ) , Supper ( Banku and Tilapia plus Special local potatoes with chicken ) , i ordered for special pop corn , khebab and fried plantains . Their food is by far the best ive tasted from any resort . The owner Maa Patricia is very friendly but i met these two people ( Solomon and Seiba ) , woooooooooow , their customer service and assistance is overwhelming . I will not hesitate to visit the place a second time . Cons : Despite the nice environment , there were few negatives . The road leading to the place was very bad and far . There were no walls around the resort ( security concerns ) , didn ' t really see any security guard around . They had some security cams but it was far from the car park . But in all I really enjoyed my stay .\",\n",

I couldn ’ t help but come here this weekend of my birthday Oct 2nd - 4th ! It was a magical experience as I swam in the lake Bosomtwe for the first time , I did my meditations by the lake at 5am with the birds singing the sun rising and the calm of the lake . The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn ’ t changed . It feels like home . They even made me a surprise birthday local food ! I will never forget this weekend . The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything . When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave . They rained insults on the whole place . I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour . If you have food just eat at home . You can ’ t bring food to a restaurant ! Why do we do this to good businesses ? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen . Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021 . Can ’ t wait to see blue and green birds and swim in lake Bosomtwe . I could live there all my life : )',\n",

You can bring your own charcoal and grill food your own as well . Dmall nighltly bonfire ( weekends only ? ) . Small but clean pool . Very nice spot for families . Drinks were on thr pricier side , but you can order them up via WhatsApp which is convenient . Rooms had AC and a mini fridge - honestly didn ' t spend much time in thr room awake . No stores nearby so bring your own snacks and maybe water . Rooms get sandy - a floor mat would be nice inside the door . Manager person ( owner ? German lady ) had great communication skills ) .\",\n",

As you drive in you can feel the peace and serenity of the resort . It ’ s very clean and the beach is well kept with lovely palm trees and shaded seating tables by the beach side . \\n \\n The Rooms : We booked a conjoining family room . I must say the rooms were a big disappointment . The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture . \\n \\n Food : Ordering food is very easy . A quick whatsapp gets you a quick response . However the food is 5 / 10 and overpriced for the quality . Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip . Cocktails are very nice . The blue diamond is as a hit . So was the Last Prayer \\n \\n Overall the tranquility of the place makes up for rooms and the food and that ’ s why I ’ m giving a 4 *',\n",
