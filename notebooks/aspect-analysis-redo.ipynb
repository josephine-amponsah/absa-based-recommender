Very diverse rooms , ranging from a suite with bathroom , some apparently without , to the Beach House , attached to the surf school of the lodge ( note that the latter are relatively distant from the rest of the lodge , it will be necessaryCount at least 5 minutes of walking , crossing the lagoon at low tide or passing through the village ) . In general , the road leading to Busua and therefore the eco lodge is rather chaotic and damaged . Count on a good driver and don ' t be afraid of the bridge over the lagoon . The team is responsive and accommodating ( we were able to change rooms at the last moment at our request , thank you Fredrick ! ) . The kitchen is cleanly fabulous , with various dishes and a different menu every day , with local products . The chef will be able to surprise you with his authentic and homemade cuisine . At the bar , Francis can prepare a whole range of cocktails tasty than each other . Special mention for your homemade akpetesthie and good humor : ) Our stay was more than pleasant , we hope to be able to come back soon !\",\n",
       " 'I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot . The location is beautiful , I loved the tree shower . I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side . The staff was friendly , even though more information would have been helpful at the check - in . We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning . The food was amazing ( even though it was a bit pricier than at other places ) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful . The only thing that really disturbed me / us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom . We tried to pack drinks / snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff . I was personally very scared during night , because you could hear them and we saw them , too when we entered our room after a day at the beach . I called reception during the night , but they couldnt do anything about it at that point . The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof , but it didnt help . They asked for our understanding , because it was an ecolodge and animal - friendly place , but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument . Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room ( which is not animal - friendly ) ; ) Moreover , the next night when I used the washroom , a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning . I only then read that other people had rat problems , too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible . Still , its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua , but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience .',\n",
       " 'For me the best hotel in Busua . Super nice staff , flexible when it comes to the wishes of the guests , grandiose cocktails and excellent food . The bridge to the lodge is unfortunately an imposition and unfortunately I have to confirm the stories with the rats from other reviews . Therefore only 4 stars .',\n",
       " 'Nice accommodation at the end of the beach . There are rooms with different comfort . We were in the \" Wood House \" and that is rather comfortable . However , the photos are from the first bungalow in the garden in front of the restaurant . The food is excellent and the cocktails are also recommended . Because of the standing water in front of the garden , mosquito spray is strongly recommended . So you can sit outside .',\n",
       " 'Everything great . Essen , drinks & accommodation .',\n",
       " \"We very much enjoyed our stay at Ahanta . The rooms and communal area are very nicely done , very cosy and clean . 3 options are offered for dinner daily ( 40 - 70ish GHS ) which were always very tasty , and as there ' s one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests . There are also cocktails available , and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare . Busua doesn ' t offer a lot to do other than surfing ( offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta ) , so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading . We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren ' t many other options . There is also the Ahanta surf / beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out . To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon , which isn ' t all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels . You can also walk the long way around , across a patchy bridge and through the ( small and not touristy ) village . One or two other things that were less than ideal : - daily wake up calls round 6 . 15 from our local rooster ( in general we enjoyed observing the chickens / roosters , goats and dogs at the lodge though ) . Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night . - due to the rainy season , everything was very slightly damp ( bed sheets , towels , clothes ) and drying was difficult , some things started to smell a little moldy - the outside area could be improved with more places to sit , especially in the sun Other than that we had a lovely , albeit quiet time , the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return !\",\n",
       " 'Great little eco lodge cornered off by a lagoon . Stayed in budget room which as the name suggests is pretty budget but still good value for money .

       " 'What a great experience and this is why . My friend and I arrived some days before checking into the space . The beautiful environment was just absolutely stunning . The tall old trees , the little garden and the use of every living thing there was breath taking . You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea . That was magical . \\n \\n My first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself . It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop . The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly . You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first . And if you are allergic or don ‚Äô t like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there . \\n The inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off . \\n \\n We checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior . Warm showers , free Wi - Fi and a quite and siren environment . \\n The workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering . They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn ‚Äô t eat there the whole stay because it was delicious . My stay there was in great harmony and peaceful and I will definitely visit this place again if I have the chance . I highly recommend this place .

       " 'Could be great or terrible depending on your luck ! \\n Let ‚Äô s start with the positives : the location is great , just by the beach , the surf school and staff is amazing , surfing conditions are great for beginners and intermediates . The food is tasty and the normal rooms are beautiful , clean and well - maintained . The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter - patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once , it can just be unpleasant if you ‚Äò re scared of such animals and hearing them close by . \\n In the middle of our stay , a large group of 10 - 12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music , laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests . Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero , it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again . \\n Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm , it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management . While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties , I also think it ‚Äô s only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future . For what it ‚Äô s worth , after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge , but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions , staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations . \\n We decided to leave the lodge early , but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4 , 5 / 5 !',\n",
       " 'Very nice , clean and unique resort , great food & helpful staff . We had three wonderful days & then it really turned bad . A huge group showed up with loud music & party all night , loud music at the breakfast and no respect for the other guests . No reaction from the staff to interrupt it . No communication from the Hotel Management . Really disappointing ! For future stays the Management should give a heads up to the other guests that a party crowd is coming .',\n",
       " '  ! ! Watch out if you want to bring your dog or you ‚Äô re fearing dogs ! ! The owners dog has bitten my dog several times and even attacked me when I defended my dog .

They didn ‚Äô t stick to what they ‚Äô ve promised us , which was unfortunate because we wanted to leave after the first attack immediately . But due to their promises we stayed . If we would have known that they have a dog who ‚Äô s defending his territory by constantly attacking other dogs we wouldn ‚Äô t have chosen this accommodation at the first place BESIDES we were told that this is a dogs - friendly place . I was especially shocked of the reaction of the owner Julia , who was reacting very arrogant after my dog and I got attacked , when we had to pass through the hall . To my defend I didn ‚Äô t see the dog being there but when I saw him he was already on his way to attack us . \\n Except from the owner Julia , the team is very friendly , welcoming and makes you feel like home but I wouldn ‚Äô t recommend staying there',\n",

       " 'My partner and I stayed for a week with Ahanta waves and really enjoyed our stay . \\n The employees are extremely welcoming and friendly . \\n Nevertheless I want to address some things that I wish I knew before my vacation there . \\n \\n 1 . The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor . For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall . Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available . So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days . \\n 2 . The sea really smells . There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach . But if you walk further ( ca . 10 min ) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell . \\n 3 . There were rats in our room . And this was something , when realised , we really struggled with . Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof . We have had our water and food poked holes into . But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me . The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls . If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room . \\n \\n Ahanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind . It ‚Äô s made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious ( 4 - 7 euros p . meal ) .

I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast . My father passed away some time back , I came with my friend , and we certainly did not receive a discount . The toilet seat was dirty , there ' s no way around that , I cleaned it . I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service . We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge . The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late , no arguing that , even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times . There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food . My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready . We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest , he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day . I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came , at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told . I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously . I caution those that want to book at Safari Beach Lodge . I truly wish the renovations are your only problems and once that is resolved the place can operate normally .\",\n",

Full recommendation ! Eine wundersch√∂ne kleine Anlage mit sechs runden Zimmern im Bungalowstil ( f√ºr je 1 - 2 Personen ) mit herrlichem Ozeanblick . Ideal , um einfach mal auszuspannen und die sch√∂ne , ruhige Landschaft bei Tag und nichts als Meeresbrandung und Grillenzirpen bei Nacht zu genie√üen . Herrlicher , breiter Sandstrand zu Fu√ü in wenigen Minuten erreichbar . Die Anlage ist in gutem Zustand ( Zimmer mit Dusche und WC , M√ºckenschutz , Ventilator , K√ºhlschrank , Safe ) , insbesondere wenn man bedenkt , im Herzen des wahren Afrikas zu sein . Die Leitung und das Personal sind sehr freundlich , die Atmosph√§re famili√§r und alles wird getan , den W√ºnschen des Gastes entgegenzukommen und den Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten . Auch wenn man nur kurz bleiben sollte , darf man die sehr gute K√ºche nicht auslassen .

The bed was big enough for us to sleep comfortably . Wifi is only available for 1 device per room . Imagine having 2 teenagers that have to share wifi connection . I ‚Äô ve never heard of this . To top it off the internet cuts out at 12am sharp . It ‚Äô s as though they turn the internet box off . Then they advertise free breakfast . This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd . The breakfast is the same for everyone . Absolutely no substitutions . The breakfast consisted of fried egg , baked bean , spring roll , bread and a bit of green salad . Portion is very small . The eggs were good . Had to throw out everything else . Very sad , bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn ‚Äô t be eaten . The pool is very unkept . Water is dirty . Thankfully this stay was only for one night . The staff made me want to pull my hair out ! They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them . They don ‚Äô t like to be asked questions . When you do ask they act as if they don ‚Äô t hear or understand my plain English . Then when they respond in a very soft / low voice and it ‚Äô s always sorry .

The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn ‚Äô t changed . It feels like home . They even made me a surprise birthday local food ! I will never forget this weekend . The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything . When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave . They rained insults on the whole place . I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour . If you have food just eat at home . You can ‚Äô t bring food to a restaurant ! Why do we do this to good businesses ? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen . Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021 .
