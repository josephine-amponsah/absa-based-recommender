I called reception during the night , but they couldnt do anything about it at that point . The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof , but it didnt help . They asked for our understanding , because it was an ecolodge and animal - friendly place , but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument . Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room ( which is not animal - friendly ) ; ) Moreover , the next night when I used the washroom , a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning .

It ’ s as though they turn the internet box off . Then they advertise free breakfast . This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd . The breakfast is the same for everyone . Absolutely no substitutions . The breakfast consisted of fried egg , baked bean , spring roll , bread and a bit of green salad . Portion is very small . The eggs were good . Had to throw out everything else . Very sad , bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn ’ t be eaten . The pool is very unkept . Water is dirty .

All the rooms are chalets with beautiful sea views that you only need to see for yourselves to understand the extent of the beauty I am trying to explain here ! There is a beautiful pool downhill that one can easily sight from the top due to its extremely blue colour . The pool was very clean and very well maintained . The lawns beautifully manicured and the natural materials incorporated into the building of the chalets together with the view give the whole place a very authentic feel and make one intuned with nature . The beach has lots of coconut trees and so there ' s enough shade to relax and enjoy the Sea breeze . Part of the beach is covered with carpet grass , which was grown by the resort . We were there for just a day , but the grill at the beach suggests fun nights at this resort . We ordered some drinks on ice and food 😋 . Of course , they didn ' t disappoint . The meal was super tasty . We were sad when it was finally time for us to leave .
